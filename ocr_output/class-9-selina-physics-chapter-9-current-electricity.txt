(A) ELECTRIC CURRENT.

9.1 SOURCES OF DIRECT CURRENT

We are familiar with cells used in a torch to
light up its bulb. The cells are the source of direct
current. They provide direct current (abbreviated
as d.c.) to the bulb. The current flows from the
positive terminal of cell to its negative terminal*
through the bulb of the torch (Fig. 9.1). The
magnitude of current given by a cell remains
constant for a sufficiently long time. When the
cell gets discharged, it stops giving current and
becomes useless. Thus we can define direct current
(d.c.) as follows :

Direct current (d.c.) is a current of constant
magnitude flowing in one direction.

* In a dry cell, brass cap projecting out at the centre
acts as the positive terminal of cell and base of zinc
case acts as the negative terminal.

In a cell, chemical energy changes into the
electrical energy when it sends current in a circuit.
A cell basically consists of two conducting
rods, called the electrodes, at some separation
placed immersed in a solution (or jelly), called
the electrolyte, kept in a vessel.

Kinds of cells : The cells are of two kinds :
(1) The primary cells, and
(2) The secondary cells or accumulators.

(1) Primary cells : These cells provide
current as a result of irreversible chemical
reaction. The cells are discarded after use when
entire chemical energy in them has converted
into the electrical energy. Thus these are ‘use
and throw' type of cells and cannot be
recharged. Depending upon the material of
electrodes and electrolyte, we have different
types of primary cells e.g. simple voltaic cell,
Leclanche cell, Daniel cell, dry cell, etc.

(2) Secondary cells or accumulators :
Secondary cells also provide current as a result
of chemical reaction. In these cells, chemical
reaction is reversible and so they can be recharged
after use. After taking the electrolyte and
electrodes in a vessel, the cell is first charged by
connecting it to a direct current source. During

179


--- Page 2 ---
charging, the electrical energy changes into the
chemical energy and gets stored in the cell. When
cell is used to send current in a circuit, the
chemical energy changes into the electrical
energy. These cells can thus be used for a very
long period because they can be recharged again
and again. Lead (or acid) accumulator and Ni-Fe
(or alkali) accumulator are the two types of
secondary cells commonly used to provide low as
well as high current. We use lead accumulator as
battery in a car as it is capable of giving high
current. Low current rechargeable cells are widely
used in toys and mobile phones. These cells are
also called the storage cells.

9.2 ELECTRIC CURRENT (AS RATE OF
FLOW OF ELECTRIC CHARGE)

We have read that when two bodies are
rubbed together, they get charged due to transfer
of electrons from one body to the other. The
body gaining electrons becomes negatively
charged while the body loosing electrons gets
positively charged. A positively charged body has
a deficit of electrons, while a negatively charged
body has an excess of electrons. The charges can

be made to flow betwéen them by suitable
arrangements. For example, if two charged bodies
are joined by a metallic wire, the electrons flow
from the body having more electrons, to the body
having less electrons. The flow of electrons
constitutes an electric current. Thus current flows
due to motion of charges. The rate of flow of
charge gives the magnitude of current. Thus

Current is the rate of flow of charge across a
cross-section normal to the direction of flow of
current.

If charge Q flows through the cross-section
of a conductor in time f¢, then

Charge(Q)

Current (D= time(?) .. (9.1)

The current is a scalar quantity.

In metals (or conductors), current flows due to
the movement of electrons, while in electrolytes,
current flows due to the movement of both, the
positive and negative ions. An electron carries a
negative charge equal to — e, where e = 1-6 x 10°!
coulomb is the electronic charge.

If n electrons pass through the cross section
of a conductor in time ¢, then

Total charge passed Q =n x e

(9.2
and current in conductor I= 2 = ™ 00.2)

Note : In an electrolyte, the current flows due to the
movement of both the positive ions (i.e., cations) and
negative ions (i.e., anions). In one second, if n, positive
ions each carrying a charge g, move in one direction and
n, negative ions each carrying a charge q, move in opposite
direction, the total current will be J = 1,(+ ¢,) — n{- 4)
= (nq, + 92), because direction of current is taken
positive in the direction of flow of positive ions, and
negative in the direction of flow of negative ions.

Direction of current (conventional and
electronic)

Conventionally, the direction of current is
taken positive in the direction of flow of positive
charge. Therefore, conventionally, the current will
be negative in the direction of flow of electrons.
The rate of flow of electrons in a direction is
called the electronic current in that direction. The
conventional current (or simply current) is in a
direction opposite to the direction of motion of

180


--- Page 3 ---
electrons. The magnitude of conventional cuirent
is the rate of flow of total charge across the given
cross-section.

Unit of current : From relation / = g
. Unit of charge
Unit of current = ——aee
Unit of time

The S.I. unit of charge is coulomb and S.I. unit

of time is second, so the S.I. unit of current is

coulomb per second which is called ampere.

It is denoted by the symbol A. Thus.
i coulomb (C)
1 second (s)

Thus current is 1 A, if the rate of flow of
charge is 1 coulomb per second. Since 1 coulomb

of charge is carried by om = 6-25 x 1018
electrons, therefore if 1 ampere current flows
through a conductor, it means that 6-25 x 10!8
electrons pass in 1 second across that cross section
of conductor.

Note : Weak current is measured in units
milli-ampere (mA) and micro-ampere (uA), where

1 milli-ampere (mA) = 10° ampére (A), and
1 micro-ampere (uA) = 10 ampere (A).
9.3. SYMBOLS USED IN~ CIRCUIT

DIAGRAMS

An electric circuit has different electric
components connected to a current source.
Fig. 9.2 shows some of the electric components
which are used in an electric circuit in the
laboratory.

The symbols and functions of various
electric components are given below.

(1) Source of current There are
two types of current sources : (i) alternating
current* (a.c.) source such as mains in our house
and a.c. generator, and (ii) direct current (d.c.)
source such as a cell or a battery. The purpose
of source of current is to supply electric current
in a circuit. In laboratory, Leclanche cell

* An alternating current (abbreviated as a.c.) is the
current in an element (say, bulb) for which both the
magnitude and direction change with time. The current
repeats its value after a fixed time. The number of
times current repeats its value in one second, is called
the frequency of alternating current. The frequency
of a.c. obtained from our mains is 50 Hz.

Fig. 9.2 Different electric components

[Fig. 9.2(a)], Daniel cell [Fig. 9.2(b)] and lead
accumulator (storage cell) [Fig. 9.2(c)] are used.

A d.c. sources (cell) is represented by two
vertical lines of unequal lengths. The longer one is
marked ‘+’ to represent anode, while the shorter is
marked ‘—’ to represent cathode [Fig. 9.3 (a)]. When
current is drawn from a cell, it flows from the
positive terminal to the negative terminal through
the external circuit and from the negative terminal
to the positive terminal inside the cell through its
electrolyte so as to maintain a continuous flow.

When a strong current is needed, either we
join a number of cells together in series (cathode
of one cell connected to the anode of another
cell), to form a battery or we use a storage cell.
Fig. 9.3(b) represents the symbol for a battery
(using three cells).

An alternating current (a.c.) source (mains)
is represented by a sine curve (~) within a circle
as shown in Fig. 9.3 (c).

(2) Key : It is used to put the current on
and off in a circuit. It may be either a plug key,

181


--- Page 4 ---
"a switch or a tapping key. Fig. 9.4 shows the
symbolic representation of these keys when they
are open and when they are closed. A key is
usually represented by the symbol K.

In laboratory, generally we use a plug key
shown in Fig. 9.2(d). When key is open (i.e.,
the plug is taken out), the circuit is incomplete
and is called an open circuit. When key is closed
(i.e., the plug is put in), current flows through
the circuit and is said to be closed. A tapping
key is used when current is momentarily needed
in the circuit.

(3) Resistance wire, resistance box,
rheostat or variable resistance : A resistance
wire is generally made from an alloy, called
manganin* and it has a fixed resistance
depending upon its length and thickness. It is
used as a standard resistance.

A rheostat [Fig. 9.2(e)] is a device by which
resistance in a circuit can be varied continuously. It
is used to adjust the magnitude of current in a
circuit by changing the length of resistance wire
included in the circuit. As shown in Fig. 9.5, it
consists of an enamelled constantan wire wound in
form of a coil (single layer) over an asbestos pipe
fitted in an iron frame and provided with a sliding

Jockey

wires in a resistance box and rheostat. It is composed

contact (jockey) on a brass rod. It has three
terminals A, B and C, out of which two terminals
A and B are at the ends of resistance wire and the
third terminal C is at the end of brass rod
connecting the jockey. The enamel of the coiled
wire is removed at the places where jockey
touches the wire.

The wire between the two terminals A and
B provides a fixed resistance equal to the
resistance of entire length of wire. When rheostat
is used as a fixed resistance R, connections are
made with the terminals A and B as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a). Symbol R is used for a fixed resistance.

The main use of a rheostat is as a smoothly
varying resistance. For this, connections are made
between the terminals C and either of the
fixed terminal A or B at the end, as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (b). The jockey connected to the middle
terminal C can be slided and by making its contact
at different points, a variable resistance can be
obtained. The current then enters at the positive
terminal A (or B), it flows in the resistance wire of
length up to the jockey and then leaves at the
terminal C. Thus rheostat provides a continuously
varying resistance to adjust current of a desired
value in the circuit. Symbol Rh is used for a
variable resistance.

A resistance box (Fig. 9.2(f)] is provided
with several standard resistances (say 1, 2, 2, 5,
10, 20, 20, 50, .... ohm) connected in series
between the two terminals. A resistance of any
desired value between 1 ohm to its maximum
value (i.e., sum of all resistances) can be used in
step of one ohm by taking out the plug of that
particular resistance from the resistance box.

(4) Ammeter : An ammeter [Fig. 9.2(g)] is
an instrument used to measure the magnitude of
current flowing in a circuit. It is joined in series
in a circuit so that the entire current of the circuit
passes through it. It is symbolically represented
by the letter A enclosed in a circle as shown in
Fig. 9.7. The + sign marked at one terminal of

182


--- Page 5 ---
it indicates that current must enter it through this
terminal. Therefore this terminal is connected to
the higher potential terminal of the current
source. An ammeter must have a very low
resistance so that the resistance of the circuit (or
the current to be measured) may not alter when
it is joined in the circuit. It has a dial on which
deflection of needle shows the magnitude of
current flowing in that circuit.

Fig. 9.7 Symbolic representation of an ammeter

Different kinds of ammeter are required to
measure the alternating current and the direct
current*.

(5) Voltmeter : A voltmeter shown in
Fig. 9.2(h) is used to measure the potential
difference between two points of a circuit. It is
connected across the two points between which
potential is to be measured (i.e., in parallel to the
flow of current). It is symbolically represented
by the letter V enclosed in a circle as shown in
Fig. 9.8. The + sign marked at one terminal of
it indicates that current must enter it through
this terminal. Therefore this terminal is
connected to the point at higher potential. A
voltmeter usually has a very high resistance so
that it does not draw an appreciable current from
the circuit. It has a dial on which deflection of
needle shows the potential difference across the
points of circuit in between which voltmeter is

connected.

difference*.

(6) Galvanometer : A galvanometer
[Fig. 9.2(i)] is used when we want to detect the
presence of very weak current in an electric circuit
or to know only the direction of flow of current in
a circuit. It does not measure the magnitude of
current in a circuit. It is joined in a circuit in series
just like an ammeter. It is symbolically represented

* An ammeter or voltmeter used to measure alternating
current is based on heating effect of current so it has
graduations of unequal spacing while to measure direct
current is based on magnetic effect of current so it
has graduations of equal spacing.

by the letter G enclosed in a circle as shown in
Fig. 9.9. Current can enter or leave through any of
its terminal, therefore no +/— signs are marked at
its terminals. It has a dial with zero mark at its
centre. The deflection of needle on it shows the
presence of current and the direction of deflection
indicates the direction of flow of current.

(7) Load : An appliance which is connected
in a circuit is called a load. It may be just a
resistance (e.g., bulb, heater etc.) or a combination
of different electrical components. It can be
represented by the symbol L as shown in Fig. 9.10.

(8) Connecting wires : These are the wires
used to connect various electrical components.
They are made of highly conducting metal such
as copper (or aluminium because of its low cost)
so that they are of negligible resistance and do not
change the resistance of the circuit. A connecting
wire may be a thick wire or several fine wires
twisted together. Generally, we use thick insulated
copper wire as a connecting wire which is
represented in a circuit diagram simply by a line.

9.4 SIMPLE ELECTRIC CIRCUIT

In our daily life, we use a torch in which a
cell (or a combination of two or more cells) is
connected to a bulb. This is the simplest electric
circuit which uses only three components viz cell,
bulb and switch. Fig. 9.11 shows a line diagram
representing the simple electric circuit containing

a cell, a bulb and a switch. As the switch is closed,
a current flows through the bulb and the bulb
glows. The flow of current stops as the switch is
opened. The bulb then ceases to glow.

Fig. 9.12 illustrates another simple electric
circuit in which various components are
the cell, key, rheostat, bulb, voltmeter and
ammeter. Here the bulb acts as a load. It is clear
that the ammeter, cell, key and rheostat are in
series* with the bulb, while voltmeter is connected
in parallel across** the bulb.

To demonstrate the functions of various
components of circuit shown in Fig. 9.12.

(i) First take out the plug from the key. This
makes the circuit incomplete (or opens the circuit).
The bulb does not glow and both the ammeter and
the voltmeter read zero since no current flows in
the circuit.

(ii) Now insert the plug in the key. The circuit
is completed (or closed). The bulb glows and the
ammeter reads current in the circuit, while the
voltmeter reads potential difference (or voltage)
across the bulb.

(iii) Then vary the resistance of the circuit by
sliding the variable terminal (or jockey) of the
theostat. The glow of bulb changes as well as the
readings of ammeter and voltmeter change. On
decreasing the resistance by sliding the jockey to
the left, the glow of bulb increases, the readings of
ammeter and voltmeter also increase. On
increasing the resistance by sliding the jockey to
the right, the glow of bulb decreases, the readings
of ammeter and voltmeter also decrease.

* The electrical components which are joined one after
another and through which the same amount of current
flows, are said to be in series.

** The electrical components which are joined with
their one terminal forming one end and second terminal
forming the other end, are said to be in parallel.

9.5 INSULATORS AND CONDUCTORS

Insulators : The substances which do not
allow the current to flow through them, are called
the insulators. They almost have no free electrons
and they offer a very high resistance in the path
of current. Some examples of insulators are
cotton, rubber, plastic, wood, paper, glass, leather,
pure water asbestors, chinaclay, etc.

Conductors : The substances which allow
the current to flow through them easily, are called
the conductors. All metals such as copper,
aluminium, silver, iron, brass and steel are
conductors. They have a large number of free
electrons and they offer a very small resistance in
the path of current. The human body also allows
current to flow through it, so it is also a conductor.
The impure water (or acidulated water) and
mercury are also the conductors of electricity.

9.6 CLOSED AND OPEN CIRCUITS

The path along which current flows, is
called a circuit. Current flows only if the circuit
is complete (or closed). If the circuit is open
(or incomplete), current does not flow.

For an electric circuit to be complete,each
component of it must pass current through it
i.e. it should be conducting. If there is an

insulator in the path (or if the circuit is
broken), the circuit is incomplete (or open) and
the current will not flow through it.

In Fig. 9.13 (a), a bulb is connected between
the two terminals A and B of a dry cell by two
metal wires. The circuit is complete and the bulb
glows. In Fig. 9.13 (b), the circuit from one
terminal A of the cell to the bulb is broken, so the
circuit is incomplete and the bulb does not glow.
In Fig. 9.13 (c), one terminal A of the cell is
connected to the bulb by a metal wire, while the
other terminal B of cell is connected to the bulb
by a thread (insulator), so the circuit is incomplete
and the bulb does not glow.

9.7 FLOW OF ELECTRONS BETWEEN THE
CONDUCTORS

When two charged conductors are joined by
a metallic wire (or they are placed in contact),
free electrons flow from a conductor having
higher concentration of electrons to the conductor
having lower concentration of electrons. The
movement of electrons stops when concentration
of electrons in both becomes equal. This can be
understood by the following examples.

Examples : (1) In Fig. 9.18, a positively

the conductor A. This movement of electrons
continues till both the conductors have equal
concentration of electrons.

(2) In Fig. 9.19, a negatively charged
conductor A is joined by a metal wire to an
uncharged conductor B. Electrons flow from the
charged conductor A (which has excess of
electrons) to the uncharged conductor B (which is
neutral). This movement of electrons stops when
both the conductors acquire equal concentration
of electrons.

(3) In Fig 9.20, two charged conductors A and
B are joined by a metal wire. The conductor A is
negatively charged, while the conductor B is
positively charged. Electrons flow from the
negatively charged conductor A (which has excess
of electrons) to the positively charged conductor B
(which has deficit of electrons). This flow of
electrons continues till there is equal concentration
of electrons in both the conductors.

Inference : From above examples, it is clear
that the flow of electrons between two conductors
.joined by a metal wire can be maintained for a
long time, if it is somehow made possible to
maintain an excess of electrons in one conductor
and a deficit of electrons in the other conductor.
This is done in an electric cell.

In an electric cell, an excess of electrons on
one electrode (i.e., cathode) and a deficit of

electrons on the other electrode (i.e., anode) are
maintained for a sufficiently long time by a
chemical reaction within the cell. Thus, an
electric cell works as a source of electrons and
there is a continuous flow of electrons in the
external circuit connected with the cell, in
direction from cathode to anode.

CURRENT — CONVENTIONAL AND
ELECTRONIC FLOW

It is our common experience that if a body
is released from a height, the body always moves
from a higher level A (away from the earth) to
the lower level B (nearer the earth surface) i.e.,
from a higher gravitational potential to the lower
gravitational potential (Fig. 9.21).

Similarly, if two vessels containing water
up to different levels are joined together, water
flows from the vessel A containing water up to a
higher level to the vessel B containing water up to
a lower level. This flow of water is due to the
difference in hydrostatic pressure (or level of
water) in the two vessels and it continues till
the level of water is same in both the vessels

(Fig. 9.22).

Fig. 9.22 Flow of water in two vessels

We have also read that if two bodies at
different temperatures are kept in contact, heat
flows by conduction from the body A at a higher
temperature to the body B at a lower temperature
till both the bodies acquire the same temperature
(Fig. 9.23).

In a similar manner, when two charged
conductors are joined by a metal wire, the direction
of flow of electrons is determined by a quantity
called the electric potential of the conductor.

Low temperature

A conductor having an excess of electrons is
said to be at a negative (or lower) potential,
while having a deficit of electrons is said to
be at a positive (or higher) potential.

In Fig. 9.24, a positively charged conductor
A having a deficit of electrons (i.e., at a high
potential) is joined by a metal wire to a negatively
charged conductor B having an excess of electrons
(i.e., at a low potential). The direction of flow of

electrons is from the conductor B to the
conductor A i.e., from low potential to high
potential. In keeping with the convention of flow
from a higher to a lower level*, the electric
current is said to flow from a body at higher
potential to a body at lower potential i.e., in a
direction opposite to the direction of flow of
electrons. Thus, the direction of flow of
conventional current is opposite to the direction
of flow of electrons.

We know that the like charges repel and unlike
charges attract, therefore to create an excess or

say that current flows from higher potential to lower potential.

deficit of electrons at a point, some work is to be
done in moving the charges (or electrons) against
the forces between them. The force between the
two charges is zero when they are at infinite
separation. Hence quantitatively, potenital at a
point is measured in terms of work done in bringing
a charge q from infinity to that point. If work W’ is
done in bringing a charge q from infinity to a
point, then potential at that point is
w’

q (9.4)

Potential is a scalar quantity. Its S.I. unit is
joule/coulomb or volt (symbol V).

Similarly the potential difference between two
conductors is measured in terms of the work done
in transferring the charge from one conductor to
the other, through a metallic wire.

V=

The potential difference between two conductors
is equal to the work done in transferring a unit
positive charge from one conductor to the other
conductor.

If work W is done in transferring a test
charge g from one conductor to the other, the
potential difference between them is

9.10 ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE

When current flows through a metallic wire
it offers some obstruction called resistance to the
flow of current through it. Thus we define
resistance as below.

188


--- Page 11 ---
The. obstruction offered to the flow of
| current’ by Hie wire is. edljed its electrical
resistance.

Cause of resistance : A metal wire © has free
electrons which move in a random manner in
absence of any cell connected across it
[Fig. 9.25 (a)]. When the ends of the wire are
connected to a cell, the electrons start moving
from the negative terminal of cell to its positive
terminal through the metal wire. During their
movement, they collide with the fixed positive
ions and other free electrons of the wire due to
which their speed decreases and their direction of
motion changes. After each collision, they again
accelerate towards the positive terminal and suffer
collisions with the other positive ions and free
electrons again. This process continues. As a
result, the electrons do not move in bulk with an
increasing speed, but they drift towards the
positive terminal. Thus the wire offers some
resistance to the flow of electrons (or current)
through it. Fig. 9.25 (b) shows the drift of
electrons in a wire. The electrons are shown by
dots(e) and the positive ions are shown as ®.

Ohm's law : According to Ohm's law*, if a
current J flows through a wire when potential
difference across the ends of the wire is V, the

is directly proportional to the potential difference applied
across its ends provided its temperature is constant. i.e.,

conductor.

resistance offered by the wire to the flow of current
is the ratio of potential difference across it to the
current flowing in it. ie.,

Resistance is a scalar quantity
Unit of resistance : From relation R =

Unit of resistance = ;
Unit of current

The S.I. unit of potential difference is
volt (V) and that of current is ampere (A), hence
S.I. unit of resistance is volt per ampere which
is named as ohm (symbol Q). Thus,

Factors affecting the resistance of a conductor

(1) The material of wire : The resistance
of a wire depends on the number of collisions
which the electrons moving through it suffer
with the other electrons and fixed positive ions

of the wire. In different materials, the
concentration of electrons and the arrangement
of atoms are different, therefore, the resistance of
wires of same length, same area of cross section,
but of different materials differ depending on
their material. Good conductors having higher
concentration of free electrons (such as metals)
offer less resistance.

(2) The length of wire : The number of
collisions suffered by the moving electrons will
be more if they have to travel a longer distance
in wire, therefore, a long wire offers more
resistance than a short wire (i.e., resistance of a
wire « length of wire).

(3) The area of cross section of wire : In
a thick wire, electrons get a larger area of cross
section to flow as compared to a thin wire,
therefore, a thick wire offers a less resistance
(i.e., resistance of wire « l/area of cross section
of wire).

189


--- Page 12 ---
(4) The temperature of the wire : If the increases and hence the resistance of wire increases
temperature of wire increases, ions in it vibrate (i.e., the resistance of a wire increases with the
more violently. As a result, the number of collisions increase in its temperature).

(C) EFFICIENT USE OF ENERGY

9.11. EFFICIENT USE OF ENERGY

The meaning of the efficient use of energy
is to reduce the cost and amount of energy to be
used to provide us the various products and
services. Energy efficiency can be achieved by
adopting more efficient ecofriendly technologies
and processes. This results in reduction of (i) the
cost of energy and (ii) the emission of green
house gases.

Examples : (1) By properly insulating a
home, it is possible to maintain a comfortable
temperature inside. It will reduce the cost of
heating devices in winter and cooling devices in
summer.

(2) The use of the fluoroscent lights or
natural skylight instead of the traditional
incandescent light bulbs, reduces the amount of
energy required to attain the same level of
illumination.

(3) The use of compact fluoroscent lights
(CFL) saves 67% energy and they may last 6 to
10 times longer than the incandescent lights.

(4) The use of LED (light emitting diode)
bulbs for lighting reduces the consumption of
energy drastically. It is also helpful in reducing
the global warming and the harmful effect of
mercury used in the fluorescent light.

(5) The modern energy efficient appliances
such as refrigerators, freezers, ovens, stoves,
dishwashers, dryers, etc. make use of
significantly less energy than the older
appliances. Nowadays appliances are star rated
according of their efficient use of electricity.

(6) A_ building's location and _ its
surroundings play a key role in regulating its
temperature and illumination. Proper placement
of the windows and skylights and the use of

‘ , 191


--- Page 14 ---
architectural features that reflect light into the
building can reduce the need of the artificial
lighting. White roof systems can save more
energy in summers.

(7) The use of advanced boilers and
furnaces in industry can save sufficient amount
of energy in attaining the high temperature by
burning less fuel. Use of such technologies is
more efficient and less polluting.

(8) The fuel efficiency in the vehicles can
be increased by reducing the weight of the
vehicle, using the advanced tyres and the
computer controlled engines.

According to the International Energy
Agency (IEA), the improved energy efficiency in
buildings, industries and transportation could
reduce the world’s energy need in 2050 by one-
third and thus it can help in control of global
emission of the green house gases.

9.12 SOCIAL INITIATIVES

The rapid depletion of energy resources and
the adverse environmental impacts of energy use,
has led to (i) the efforts so as to develope the
energy efficient machines (ii) the technologies
which can reduce the energy expenditure and
minimize the environmental hazards. It has
become essential to create awareness amongst
the people and build in them the trends of
sensitive use of the resources and products so as
to reduce the use of electricity. Public awareness
can be improved through mass-media and
children's participation in compaigns and eco-
club activities. Community involvement will
surely be effective in reducing the misuse of
electricity. The non-government organisations
(NGO's) can be used to create social awareness
of the sensitive use of the resources.
