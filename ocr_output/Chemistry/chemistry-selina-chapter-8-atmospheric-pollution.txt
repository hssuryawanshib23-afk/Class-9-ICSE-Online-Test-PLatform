8.1 INTRODUCTION

The environment comprises the physical and
biological world in which we live, that is, air, water
and land. It changes from region to region, since it
results from a combination of different factors.

Industrial activities and faster modern modes
of transport add harmful substances to the
environment. These substances are harmful and
potentially toxic. They are considered to be the
principle cause of pollution.

Environmental pollution is the effect of undesirable
changes in our surroundings that have a harmful

effect on plants, animals and human beings.

The word ‘pollution’ is derived from the Latin
word ‘pollutes’, which means “made dirty”.
Pollution is created by harmful substances generally
produced by human beings. At times, nature also
pollute the environment. The substances (pollutants)
that contaminate and degrade earth’s environment
have an adverse impact not only on human life but
also on plants and animals. Nature certainly has the
capacity to accommodate some of these pollutants
by way of recycling or storage in harmless form.
However, when these pollutants are added to the
environment at a rate much faster than nature, it
leads to the deterioration of environment.

Toxic and otherwise harmful substances that have

an undesirable impact on different components of the
environment and life forms, are known as pollutants.

SYLLABUS

Sulphur in fossil fuels giving oxides of sulphur when burnt. High temperatures in furnaces and internal combustion
engines produce oxides of nitrogen. (Equations to be included). Acid rain affects soil chemistry and water

Greenhouse gases — their sources and ways of reducing their presence in the atmosphere.
(Water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and oxides of nitrogen).

Destruction of the ozone layer — chemicals responsible for this to be named but reactions not required.

On the basis of their origin (sources), pollutants
are of two types : natural and man-made.

Natural sources of air pollutants

e Volcanoes. Volcanoes release large amounts of
air pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulphur
dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, chlorine, hydrogen
chloride, hydrocarbons and particulates.

e Decaying vegetation. Microbial action on
organic matter in soil releases pollutant i.e.,
nitrous oxide.

e Forest fires release poisonous gas carbon
monoxide.

e Winds and dust storms carry particulate matter
like sand and dust.

Man-made sources of air pollutants

e Automobiles use diesel or petrol as fuel.
Incomplete combustion of these fuels releases
carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, hydrocarbons,
nitrogen oxides and particulates like lead.

e Factories release carbon dioxide, sulphur
dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and particulates.

e Industrial processes release different types of

air pollutants, depending upon the type of
process involved.
Examples : Coal power plants release carbon
monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ash and smoke.
Fertilizer industries release nitrogen oxides and
ammonia.

e Decay of crop residue in rural areas is the main
source of carbon monoxide and methane.

8.2 AIR POLLUTION

Air. pollution means degradation of air
quality due to concentration of harmful

contaminants that affects human, plant and
animal lives.

If composition of air is altered, it affects not
only human life but also animal and plant life, and
the atmosphere is then said to be polluted.

Air pollution is caused due to the presence of
gaseous pollutants like oxides of sulphur, nitrogen,

carbon, hydrocarbons, and particulate pollutants like
dust, smoke, mist, spray and fume.

8.2.1 Gaseous pollutants and their effects

Sulphur dioxide affects yield of crops and
causes damage to lungs.

Hydrogen sulphide gas reduces growth of
crops and causes irritation to human eyes.

Fluorides cause destruction of vegetation and
affects teeth and bones.

Nitrogen oxides cause death of many plants
and are suspected to cause cancer.

Carbon monoxide prevents haemoglobin from
carrying oxygen to different parts of the body.

Tobacco smoke causes lung cancer.

Lead, which enters air from motor vehicles
using tetraethyl lead, impairs the body’s metabolic
activities.

Cotton dust produces lung fibrosis and smoke
particles cause asthma and other lung diseases.

A pollutant, which is a combination of
oxides of nitrogen and sulphur and of partially-
oxidized hydrocarbons and their derivatives

produced by industries and automobiles forms a
dark, thick, dust and soot laden fog and is
known as smog.

Smog is noxious and irritating. It reduces

_ visibility, induces respiratory troubles, and can

cause death by suffocation.

The other main pollutants together contribute
to more than 90% of global air pollution, and they
are as follows :

e Nitrogen oxides (N,O, NO and NO,)
¢ Hydrocarbons (mainly methane, CH,)
e Sulphur oxides (SO, and SO,)

e Hydrogen sulphide (H,S)

e Carbon monoxide (CO)

e Particulates (small solid particles and liquid
droplets)

Oxides of nitrogen as air pollutants
Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO,)

enter the atmosphere in the following ways :

¢ On burning of fuels in furnaces, temperature
increases. At high temperature, nitrogen and
oxygen present in air combine to form oxides
of nitrogen.

e When fuel burns in an internal combustion
engine, oxides of nitrogen are produced, and
they enter the atmosphere as exhaust gases
from automobile engines.

e Nitric acid is formed by the reaction between
atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen in the
presence of electric discharge, which happens
during thunder storms, when there is lightning.


--- Page 3 ---
e Nitric oxide further reacts with atmospheric
oxygen (O,) and ozone (O,) to form nitrogen
dioxide.

2NO + O,(g) > 2NO,(g)
NO(g) + O03(g)  NO,(g) + O,(g)

Harmful effects of the oxide of nitrogen

Nitrogen dioxide (NO,) is very harmful to
plants and animals.

1. It causes irritation in mucous membrane.

2. Large concentrations of NO, may cause serious
lung diseases.

3. Nitrogen dioxide causes serious injury to
vegetation; it damages plant leaves.

4. In sunlight, nitrogen dioxide oxidizes hydro-
carbons to form photochemical smog.
Photochemical smog causes eye irritation,
asthma attacks and nasal and throat infections.

Compounds of sulphur as pollutants

Compounds of sulphur like sulphur dioxide
(SO,), sulphur trioxide (SO,) and hydrogen
sulphide (H,S) are pollutants.

1. Hydrogen sulphide (H,S) is produced by
decaying organic matter, such as rotten
vegetables, by sewage and certain industrial
operations.

Harmful effects of hydrogen sulphide

It causes nausea and irritates the eye and the
throat. Being acidic in nature, H,S destroys
vegetable matter.

2. Sulphur dioxide (SO,) and sulphur trioxide
(SO,) are produced by combustion of sulphur
containing fuels like coal and oil. It is also
produced by metallurgical processes involving
sulphide ores.

Harmful effects of oxides of sulphur

e It causes headache, vomiting and even death
due to respiratory failure.

e It destroys vegetation and weakens building
materials/constructions.

¢ It mixes with smoke and fog to form smog,
which is very harmful.

e It is oxidized by atmospheric oxygen into
sulphur trioxide (SO,), which combines with
water to form sulphuric acid (H,SO,).
Sulphuric acid is the cause of acid rain.

2S0,(g) + O,(g) > 2SO,(g)
SO,(g) + H,O() > H,SO,(aq)
Carbon monoxide (CO) as air pollutant

Carbon monoxide is formed by incomplete
combustion of fuels in homes, factories and
automobiles. Carbon monoxide is a highly
poisonous gas.

If inhaled, it passes through the lungs directly
into the blood stream. There it combines with
haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen to
body tissues. Because haemoglobin binds with
carbon monoxide more than 200 times more strongly
than does oxygen, even low concentrations of carbon
monoxide in air have magnified effects on the body.
It reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood by
an amount equivalent to the amount of haemoglobin
converted into carboxy haemoglobin.

Haemoglobin + CO — Carboxy haemoglobin

Since heart and brain are the two tissues most
sensitive to oxygen depletion, they show the most
serious effects of carbon monoxide exposure. In
high concentration, carbon monoxide may thus kill
by paralyzing normal brain action.

Control of carbon monoxide pollution

Carbon monoxide pollution can be controlled
in the following ways :

(a) By switching over from internal combustion
engines to electrically powered cars.

Although the latter would transfer source of
pollution to power companies, it is easy to
control the pollution created by power
companies.

(b) Many pollution control devices are now
installed in cars. Most of these devices
help reduce pollution by burning gasoline
completely. Complete combustion of gasoline
produces only carbon dioxide and water vapour.

(c) By using substitute fuels for gasoline : Natural
gas in both compressed (CNG) and liquefied
forms (LNG) is now increasingly being used as
fuel. Alcohols are other feasible substitutes.

8.3. ACID RAIN

The term ‘acid rain’ is used to describe all
precipitations — rain, snow, fog, dew — that are
more acidic than normal water. Normal rain is only
slightly acidic, having pH about 5-6; this is
because carbon dioxide reacts with it to form weak
carbonic acid.

CO, + H,O > H,CO,

pH of acid rain usually ranges between 5-6 and

3-5; at times it can be as low as 2.

8.3.1 Composition of Acid Rain

Acid rain results from acids like nitric acid and
sulphuric acid present in polluted air. These acids
are formed when oxides of nitrogen and sulphur
come into contact with rain water.

8.3.2 Causes of Acid Rain

Fossil fuels contain compounds of nitrogen and
sulphur in addition to carbon. Due to combustion

Formation of Nitric acid

Nitric acid is formed by the combination of
nitrogen and oxygen, i.e. oxides of nitrogen.
Nitrogen and oxygen combine in the presence of
thunder and lightning. Oxides of nitrogen are also
produced by internal combustion engines
(automobile engines).

N, + O, high temperature | INO
Nitrogen oxide then gets oxidized in the
atmosphere to nitrogen dioxide.
2NO + O, — 2NO,
Nitrogen dioxide combines with water to form
a mixture of nitrous acid and nitric acid.
2NO, + H,O > HNO, + HNO,

Formation of Sulphuric acid

Coal used in power plants contains up to 4%
sulphur. Combustion of coal forms sulphur dioxide.
Petroleum products also release sulphur dioxide on
combustion.

Some sources of oxides of sulphur are chemical
plants, metal-processing plants and copper, lead and
zinc smelting industries. Sulphur is a non-metallic
element found in coal (fossil fuels) and fuel oil.
When these fuels are burned, sulphur combines with
oxygen in air to form its gaseous oxides, sulphur
dioxide (SO,) and sulphur trioxide (SO,).

S +0, > SO,
280, + O, — 2SO,;

Sulphur dioxide and sulphur trioxide react
with water to form H,SO,, which is the main
cause of acid rain.

2SO, + O, + 2H,O > 2H,SO,
SO, + H,O — H,SO,
8.3.3 Impact of Acid Rain

(i) Acid rain affects soil chemistry. It removes
‘calcium and potassium, both the basic
ingredients of soil, thus making it lose its
fertility, which ultimately damages forests.
Acid rain causes loss of nutrients from plants,
thus damaging their leaves.

(ti) Acid rain has serious ecological impacts, as it
affects water bodies too. The water of lakes

and rivers is gradually becoming acidic due to
acid rain, which is affecting aquatic life.

(i) Acid rain causes extensive damage to building
and sculptural materials like marble, limestone,
slate, mortar, etc. These materials become
pitted and thus weaken mechanically.

CaCO, + H,SO, — CaSO, + CO, + H,O
CaCO, + 2HNO, — Ca(NO,), + CO, + H,O
The Taj Mahal is facing this serious problem.

(iv) Acid rain increases corrosion of metals. For
example, formation of rust on structures like
iron gates and iron frames increases due to
acid rain.

(v) Acid rain impacts humans too. In sufficiently
high concentrations it can affect a person’s
breathing. Sulphur dioxide irritates the upper
respiratory tract, the part of our body that
serves to expel soot particles and dust from
inhaled air. In lower concentrations, it injures
lung tissues.

Reducing the impact of Acid Rain :

The impact of acid rain can be reduced by
checking the root cause of acid rain, i.e. by
reducing the emission of oxides of sulphur and
nitrogen. This can be done by using coal or oil
with low sulphur content.

We can also reduce such emissions by using
a scrubber, a device that absorbs gaseous
pollutants. A scrubber used for removing sulphur
dioxide from a smoke stack usually consists of a
fine spray of water and gas rising from the stack,
which is passed through the scrubber, where water
absorbs sulphur dioxide. Thus the formation of this
constituent of acid rain is reduced.

8.4 GLOBAL WARMING

About three-fourth of the sun’s energy reaching
the earth is absorbed by the earth’s surface, which
causes an increase in the temperature of the earth’s
surface. Some heat is also trapped by green house
gases, i.e. carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
ozone, chloro-fluoro-carbon compounds (CFC) and
water vapour present in the atmosphere. This
causes GLOBAL WARMING.

8.4.1 Green house effect

Heating of the earth and its environment due to
solar radiation trapped by carbon dioxide and

water vapour in the atmosphere is called
greenhouse effect.

The name green house comes from glass
structures called green houses that are used to
grow green plants in the colder regions of the
earth. The glass structure allows sunlight to
enter it but does not allow the radiated heat to
escape, thus heating up the green house.

8.4.2 Greenhouse gases :

Gases that contribute to greenhouse effect are
carbon dioxide, water vapour, oxides of nitrogen,
methane, ozone, chloro-fluro-carbons, etc., and are
thus called green house gases. The relative
contributions of these gases towards green house
effect is given in the following table :

Gases. CO, CH, CFC 0, N,O H,O

% contribution 50 19 17 8 4 2

Sources of greenhouse gases
sources of greenhouse gases are :

: The major

Carbon dioxide

e Burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas
and petroleum.

e Industrial processes like manufacture of lime
and those seen in fermentation units.

e Biological decay of plants.

e Respiration by animals, human beings and
plants.

Water vapours

The main source of water vapour is burning
of hydrocarbons. This produces carbon dioxide and
water vapour.

Hydrocarbon + Oxygen — Carbondioxide + Water vapour

Oxides of Nitrogen

Combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil,
natural gas, gasoline, etc. in automobiles and power
plants produce high temperatures, whereupon
nitrogen and oxygen combines to form nitric oxide
and nitrogen dioxide. Some chemical industries
also produce oxides of nitrogen as by-products.

Methane

It is emitted in large quantities during
anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in soil,
water and sediments. Incomplete combustion of
fossil fuels also produces methane and other
hydrocarbons.

Mechanism of Green House effect

Sunlight reaching the earth consists of three
types of radiations, namely, ultraviolet (UV)
radiation, visible radiation and infra-red (IR)
radiation. As sunlight passes through the
atmosphere, most of the UV radiation is absorbed
by ozone; 30% of IR radiation reaches the earth’s
surface, heating up the surface. As the earth
becomes hot, it starts emitting radiations with less
energy than the incoming radiations and thus with
longer wavelength. Some emitted infrared radiations
escape from the earth’s surface and some are
absorbed by CO,, thus remaining on the earth.

Trapped radiation warms both the earth’s surface
and the lower parts of the atmosphere.

Advantages of Green House effect

e Green House effect has played an important
role in the evolution of life on earth. Without
the Green House gases, all the heat coming
from the sun would have escaped from the
earth, which would then become as cold and
barren as the moon.

e It is necessary for evaporation of water and
formation of clouds, leading to rain.
Although green house gases are important for
survival of life on earth, there is an optimum level
for them. If the proportion of Green House gases
increases, earth’s surface temperature will also rise.
Rise in average temperature of the earth’s surface
is called Global Warming. A slight increase in the
world’s temperature, say, of 1°C to 3°C, can have
far-reaching consequences for the earth’s environment.

Effects of Global Warming

e Rise in sea level : Due to global warming,

glaciers and polar ice caps have started to melt,
and gradually this may lead to an increase in
sea level. This will in turn flood several coastal
areas in countries like India, Bangladesh,
Netherlands and Maldives.

e Global warming will cause more water to
evaporate from water bodies, thus forming more
water vapour. Since water vapour also
contributes to green house effect, global
warming will further increase.

e Global warming can lead to changes in rain
pattern and thus shift in crop zones. For
example, the wheat producing zones will shift
from Russia and Canada to the less fertile polar
regions.

e Change in rain pattern due to global warming
will also affect trees and plants in forests that
are natural habitats of wild life. With
destruction of forests many species of wild life
will also begin to die out.

Note : If the level of CO, continues to rise at
the present rate, the earth will become warmer

by 1°C to 3°C by 2050 A.D.

Ways of Reducing Global Warming
(i) Minimize use of automobiles : depending on
the situation, one can use bicycle or the public
transport system and car pools.

(ii) Plant more trees to increase the green cover.

(ii) Avoid burning of dry leaves, wood, etc.

(iv) Avoid smoking. It is illegal to smoke in public
places and work places, because smoke is
harmful not only for the one who is smoking
but also to others sitting nearby.

(v) Help the people in understanding global
warming; most people are unaware of it.

8.5 OZONE

Ozone is a light bluish gas found in the upper
layer of atmosphere (stratosphere). Ozone is formed
by the action of ultraviolet rays of the sun on
oxygen.

30,(g) — 20,(g)

8.5.1 Function of ozone in the atmosphere

The ozone layer acts as a blanket in the
atmosphere above 16 km from the earth’s surface.
Ozone absorbs the harmful ultra-violet rays coming
from the sun and thus prevents them from reaching
the earth. Thus it protects the life on earth from
harmful effects of ultra-violet rays that can :

(i) cause skin cancer

(ii) destroy many organisms necessary for life in
general.

High energy ultra-violet radiation, also known
as far UV, helps in breaking oxygen molecules into
oxygen atoms.

0,+UV ~>0+0

Oxygen atom then reacts with oxygen
molecule to form ozone.

O0+0,—>0,
Net reaction : 30, + UV > 20,

The ozone produced absorbs UV radiations of
comparatively longer wave lengths forming oxygen
molecule and oxygen atom.

0; > 0,+0

8.5.2 Destruction of ozone layer

Decrease in quantity of ozone in the upper
layer of atmosphere is called DEPLETION OF
OZONE, which leads to the formation of an
OZONE HOLE. Due to the ozone hole, ultraviolet
rays of the sun reach the earth and cause diseases
like skin cancer. In 1980, scientists detected an
ozone hole above Antarctica.

An equilibrium is set up between generation
and destruction of ozone such that, under normal
conditions, ozone concentration remains constant.
Pollutants like oxides of nitrogen, free chlorine
radicals, etc. are produced in the atmosphere.
Molecules of ozone react with these pollutants and

-

— . . _# aoa

Fig. 10.5 Ozone hole — depletion

get destroyed. This causes DEPLETION OF
OZONE LAYER.

8.5.3 Chemicals responsible for destruction of
ozone layer

(1) Excessive use of chlorofluoro carbons :
Chloro-fluoro-carbons (freons) enter the
atmosphere because of their excessive use in
solvents, aerosol sprays, propellants, refrigerants
and blowing agents for plastic foams.
Chloro-fluoro-carbons are decomposed by
ultra-violet rays to highly reactive chlorine,
which is produced in its atomic form.

CF,Cl, (g) Ultraviolet rays CF,Cl (g) +Cl (g)

(free radical)
This free radical [Cl] reacts with ozone, and
chlorine monoxide is formed.
Cl(g) + O3(g) — ClO(g) + O,(g)

This causes depletion of ozone, and chlorine
monoxide further reacts with atomic oxygen to
produce more free radicals of chlorine.

ClO(g) + O(g) > Cl(g) + O,(g)
Again this free radical [Cl] destroys ozone,
and the process continues, giving rise to large-
scale ozone depletion.

(2) Fuel of planes : When the fuel of planes
burn, a large quantity of nitric oxide and other
gases are emitted in the atmosphere. Nitric
oxide reacts with ozone to form nitrogen
dioxide and nitrogen trioxide.

NO(g) + 0,(g) > NO,(g) + O,(g)
NO.(g) + O,(g) > NO,(g) + O,(g)
This also causes depletion of ozone.



--- Page 9 ---
Harmful effects of ozone

Ozone is a poisonous gas with a chlorine like
smell.

(i) It causes respiratory problems.
(ii) It damages plants and trees.

(ili) It causes damage to automobile tyres and
asphalt.

In the stratosphere, the reactive species of
chlorine gets locked up and is thus unable to stop

depletion of ozone.

Locking of chlorine monoxide and free radicals
of chlorine is called SCAVENGING. In the
atmosphere, nitrogen dioxide scavanges chlorine
monoxide and methane scavanges chlorine atoms.
These scavangers react with chlorine monoxide and
free radicals of chlorine (Cl).

ClO(g) + NO,(g) > CIONO,(g)

CHAPTER AT GLANCE

Environmental pollution is the effect of undesirable changes in our surroundings that have harmful
effects on plants, animals and human beings.

Reduces oxygen in blood causing
retardation and dizziness.

Smog (combination of fog and smoke)
produces acid rain that makes children
more susceptible to respiratory diseases.

Smog and acid rain containing sulphuric
acid make children more susceptible to
respiratory diseases.

Pollution may be defined as contamination of air, water or soil by undesirable amounts of materials or
heat and is caused by the concentration of substances that have harmful effects.

Air pollution is caused due to the presence of (i) gaseous pollutants, like oxides of sulphur, nitrogen
and carbon, (ii) by hydrocarbons, and (iii) by particulate pollutants like dust, smoke, mist and fume.

Acid rain is a result of acids like nitric acid and sulphuric acid. These acids are formed when oxides

of nitrogen and sulphur present in air come in contact with rain water.



--- Page 10 ---
Nitrogen and oxygen combine in the presence of thunder and lightining or inside internal combustion
engines to produce nitrogen oxides, which get converted into nitrogen dioxide, which then reacts with

rain water to form nitric acid.

Sulphur present in fossil fuels forms oxides on burning; these oxides react with rain water to produce

sulphuric acid.

Acid rain causes damage to buildings and forests, corrodes metals, and even damages plants.

Heating of the earth and its environment due to radiations of the Sun trapped by carbon dioxide and
water vapour in the atmosphere is called greenhouse effect.

The name green house has been adopted from a glass structure called a green house, which is used to
grow green plants in the colder regions of the earth. The glass structure allows sunlight to reach inside
it but does not allow reflected radiations to escape, thus heating up the green house.

Rise in average temperature of earth’s surface is caused by the radiations trapped in the earth’s

atmosphere.

Due to global warming, glaciers melt, more water evaproates, and pattern of rain fall changes.
