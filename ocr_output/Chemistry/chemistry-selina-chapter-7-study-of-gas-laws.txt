7.1 INTRODUCTION

The state of matter in which inter-particle
attraction is weak and inter-particle space is so large
that the particles become completely free to move
randomly in the entire available space is known as
Gas. Gas occupies the entire space of the vessel in
which it is kept and so takes the shape of the vessel.
All gases show uniform behaviour under similar
conditions of temperature and pressure irrespective
of their chemical nature or colour or odour.

7.22 BEHAVIOUR AND CHARACTERISTIC

PROPERTIES OF GASES

Gases are composed of molecules (particles)
that are in constant random motion. Kinetic theory
helps in explaining the simple relationship that
exists between the pressure, the volume, and the
temperature of a gas.

The kinetic molecular theory, explains the
behaviour and characteristic properties of gases:

(1) Composition of gases : Gases are made up
of tiny particles (molecules) moving in all possible
directions at all possible speeds. The molecules are
negligibly small in size as compared to the volume
occupied by the gas.

(2) Gases have neither a fixed volume nor a
fixed shape : There is negligible force of attraction
between the particles (gas molecules). Therefore, the
particles (gas molecules) are free to move in the
entire space available to them, their movement is

restricted only by the walls of the container. Thus,
they attain the shape of the containing vessel.

(3) Gases exert pressure in all directions: The
moving particles (molecules) of a gas collide with
each other and also with the walls of the container.
Due to these collisions, gas molecules exert pressure.
It has been found, that at a given temperature, time
and area, the same number of molecules of a gas
strike against the walls of the container. Thus, gases
exert the same pressure in all directions.

(4) Gases are highly compressible : There are
large inter-particle (inter-molecular) spaces between
gas molecules, and this accounts for the high
compressibility of gases. On applying pressure, the

molecules come closer, thus decreasing the volume

of the gas.

(5) Gases are highly expansible : Gases
increase in volume on decrease in pressure and
increase in temperature.

When pressure on an enclosed gas is reduced,
its particles (molecules) move apart, thus increasing
their inter-molecular spaces. As a result, the volume
of the gas increases.

When an enclosed gas is heated, kinetic energy
of its molecules increases. Thus, the molecules start
moving faster and farther apart from each other,
resulting in an increase in the volume of the gas.

(6) Gases have low density : The number of
molecules per unit volume in a gas is very small as

—_—_ 1


--- Page 2 ---
compared to solids and liquids. Gases have large
inter-molecular space between their molecules.
Therefore, gases have very low density.

(7) Gases have a natural tendency to
mix with one another (diffusion) : Inter-particle
(inter-molecular) spaces in a gas are very large. When
two gases are brought in contact with each other, their
molecules mix with each other in such a manner that
a homogeneous gaseous mixture is formed.

Diffusion is the process of gradual mixing of two
substances, kept in contact, by molecular motion.

If you open a jar of chlorine or ammonia in a large
room, the odorous presence of the gas can be detected
in every part of the room within a few seconds.
Although chlorine is heavier than air, it does not
remain at the floor but spreads throughout the room.

The particles (molecules) of chlorine coming
out of the jar collide with air particles (molecules)
and due to the collisions of the particles, they start
moving in a haphazard manner in all possible
directions. This process continues till there is an
equal concentration of chlorine particles (molecules)
throughout the room.

(8) Gases can be liquefied : On cooling, the kinetic
energy of the molecules of a gas is reduced and on
applying pressure on a cooled gas, the molecules come
closer. Hence, the inter-molecular space gets reduced
and there is an increase in the number of molecules per
unit volume. Thus, the gas liquefies.

7.3. MOLECULAR MOTION: RELATIONSHIP OF
TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE AND VOLUME

According to the kinetic model, particles
(molecules) of a substance are in constant random
motion, so they possess kinetic energy.

The average kinetic energy of a particle
(molecule) is directly proportional to its absolute
temperature.

As temperature increases, molecular motion
increases, and when temperature decreases, molecular
motion also decreases. This suggests that when the
temperature is zero, molecular motion ceases
(theoretical concept). This fact is applied in defining
a scale of temperature called Kelvin scale*.

* Kelvin scale is also called the absolute scale of temperature.

The temperature at which the molecular motion
completely ceases (theoretical concept), on the

Kelvin scale, is called absolute zero.

Absolute zero or zero kelvin is equal to
—273°C. Obviously, temperatures lower than
absolute zero, i.e., -273°C are not possible.

When a gas is enclosed in a vessel, it exerts
uniform pressure on the walls of the containing
vessel. The reason is that the particles (molecules)
of the gas collide with each other and with the walls
of the containing vessel. Since a large number of
particles (molecules) suffer collisions with the wall,
an appreciable force acts on the wall. The force
exerted on a unit area of the wall of the vessel is
equal to the pressure of the gas.

But, when the temperature of the gas is
increased, keeping its volume constant, the average
kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases and
therefore average speed of the molecules also
increases. The molecules now strike the walls of the
container with greater momentum (momentum is the
product of mass and velocity) and the rate of
collision of the particles (molecules) also increases.
Thus, the force exerted on the walls of the container
increases, which results in an increase in the
pressure exerted by the gas.

If one of the walls of the container is movable,
then, due to the increased pressure, that wall is
pushed back and the gas expands. Thus, volume also
increases with the increase in molecular motion.
7.4 THE GAS LAWS

The behaviour of a gas under known
conditions of pressure, volume and temperature is
described by laws known as Gas Laws.

Standard variables for gas laws :

The physical behaviour of gases can be
described by three standard variables :

(i) volume (V) (ii) pressure (P)

(iii) temperature (7).

All gases are similar in their physical behaviour;
they expand and contract equally under similar
conditions of temperature and pressure. For a given
mass of a gas, a change in one or more than one
variable, i.e., pressure, volume and temperature,
results in a change in the remaining variables.


--- Page 3 ---
(a) The volume (V) of a gas is the space
occupied by that gas. The space occupied by a gas
is equal to the volume of its container.

Units of volume :
In S.J. system, volume of a gas is measured
in cubic metre (m3). Other units are:
(i) cubic centimetre (cm?)
(ii) millilitre (mL)
(iii) cubic decimetre (dm?)
(iv) litre (L)
Relationship between units :

1 m? = 1000 dm? = 1000 litres

1 Litre = 1000 mL = 1000 cm’.

(b) The pressure (P) of a gas is the force that
the gas exerts per unit area on the walls of its
container.

Our planet is surrounded by a thick blanket of
air known as atmosphere. The pressure exerted by
air (present in the atmosphere) on the surface of
the earth is called atmospheric pressure.

Standard pressure of one atmosphere (1 atm) is
defined as the pressure exerted by 76 cm of mercury at
0°C and at standard gravity of 9:8 m s~? (density
of mercury = 13-5951 g cm™). °

The S.I. unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa)
Pascal (Pa) is defined as the pressure exerted
when a force of 1 Newton acts on an area of 1 m7.
Units of pressure :
(i) Pascal (Pa)
(ii) Atmosphere (atm)
(iii) (a) in centimetre (cm Hg),
(b) in millimetre (mm Hg),
(c) in torr (named after Torricelli),

Relationship between these units :
1 atm = 76:0 cm Hg = 760 mm Hg
= 760 torr

(c) The temperature (7) of a gas is defined
as the degree of hotness of that gas.

The more commonly used scale of temperature
is Celsius scale, formerly known as the Centigrade
scale. The zero on Celsius scale is purely arbitrary.
In other words, temperature of a substance may go
below zero i.e. a substance can have negative
temperatures too. The behaviour of gases show

that it 1s not possible to have temperature below
—273°C. This fact has led to the formulation of
another scale known as Kelvin scale. The zero on
this scale corresponds to —273°C.

Relationship between Kelvin (K) and degree
Celsius (°C)

Celsius scale values can be converted to
Kelvin scale values by adding 273 to degree
Celsius values.

Kelvin (K) = °C + 273.

7.5 PRESSURE AND
RELATIONSHIP IN GASES

Experiment —Take a 10 mL syringe fitted
with a piston. Raise the latter to the 10 mL
mark and wrap an adhesive tape over its nozzle. Fit
the wrapped nozzle tightly into a hole, bored half way
through a rubber stopper (Fig. 7.1).

Observation : On
placing some weight on
the piston (to put pressure),
it moves downward and
reduces the volume of
air. Gradually, put some more
weight. The piston moves
further downward and the
volume of the air is further
reduced.

Fig. 7.1 Pressure-
volume relationship

1. An increase in pressure at constant temperature
causes a decrease in the volume of a gas;
conversely, if the volume of a fixed mass of a
gas at constant temperature is decreased, the
pressure of the gas increases.

2. A decrease in pressure at constant temperature
causes an increase in the volume of a gas;
conversely, if the volume of a fixed mass of a
gas at constant temperature is increased, the
pressure of the gas decreases.

7.5.1 Boyle’s law

Robert Boyle systematically studied the
relationship between pressure and volume of gases.


--- Page 4 ---
In 1662, he tound that, at constant temperature’, the
volume of a fixed mass of a dry gas decreased by half
when the pressure on it was doubled, and it became
four times its original volume when its pressure was
decreased to one-fourth. He described this behaviour
in the form of a law, known as Boyle’s law.

Boyle’s law : Volume of a given mass of a dry gas
is inversely proportional to its pressure at
constant temperature.

Mathematical expression of Boyle’s law :

Suppose a gas occupies volume V, when its
pressure is P,; then

1 &
V, oc R or V, = B
or P,V, = k = constant

If V, is the volume occupied when the pressure is
P, at the same temperature, then

k

V, o or Y= p

1
P,
or P,V, = k = constant
“. PV, = P,V, =k; at constant temperature.
This is called Boyle’s law equation.

Boyle’s law may also be stated as : the product of
volume and pressure of a given mass of a dry gas at
a constant temperature is constant.

7.5.2 Graphical verification of Boyle’s law

The law can be verified by plotting a graph

7.5.3 Explanation of Boyle’s law in terms of
molecular motion (kinetic theory).

According to the kinetic theory of gases, number
of particles (molecules) present in a given mass and
the average kinetic energy possessed by the particles
is constant.

If volume of a given mass of a dry gas is reduced
to half its original volume, the same number of
particles (molecules) will have half the space to
move. As a result, the number of molecules striking
at unit area of the walls of the container at a given
time will get doubled and so the pressure also gets
doubled. Conversely, if the volume of a given mass
of a gas is doubled at constant temperature, the same
number of molecules will have double the space to
move about. Consequently, the number of molecules
striking at unit area of the walls of the container at a
given time will become one half of the original value.
Thus, pressure of the gas will be reduced to half of


--- Page 5 ---
its original pressure. Hence it is seen that if pressure
increases, the volume of a given mass of
gas decreases at constant temperature (BOYLE’S
LAW).

7.5.4 Significance of Boyle’s Law

On increasing pressure, volume decreases. The
gas becomes denser. Thus at constant temperature,
the density of a gas is directly proportional to its
pressure.

Atmospheric pressure is low at high altitudes,
so air is less dense. Hence, a lesser quantity of
oxygen is available for breathing. This is the reason
why mountaineers have to carry oxygen cylinders
with them.

Note : When air is blown into a balloon,
volume and pressure inside the balloon increase.
Here, Boyle’s law is not violated as the law is valid
for a definite mass, whereas mass increases when
more air is blown into the balloon.

Solved examples

Example 1 : A gas occupies 800 cm? under
760 mm Hg pressure. Find under what pressure the gas
will occupy 380 cm}, the temperature remaining
constant.

Solution :
P, = 760 mm Hg; V, = 800 cm?
P,=2mmHg; _ V, = 380 cm

By Boyle’s law, P|V, = P,V,
Substituting the values,
760 x 800 = P, x 380
760x800
1600 mm Hg = 160cm Hg

Ans. : The required pressure is 160 cm Hg.

Example 2 : A gas occupies 600 cm? under a pressure
of 700 mm Hg. Find under what pressure the volume
of the gas will be reduced by 20 per cent of its original
volume, the temperature remaining constant throughout?
Solution :
600 x 20
20% of 600 cm? = —p9— = 120 cm?
.. The new volume of the gas
= 600 — 120 = 480 cm?
P, = 700 Hg; V, = 600 cm?
P, = ? mm Hg; V, = 480 cm?

By Boyle’s law, P,V, = P,V,
Substituting the values,
700 x 600 = P, x 480

, = 100%*600 — 875 mm Hg

Ans. : The required pressure is 875 mm Hg.
Example 3 : Two cylinders, both containing carbon
dioxide, are connected together by a tube fitted with a
tap. The capacity of one cylinder is 4 dm? and that of

Example 4 : The volume of a given mass of a
gas with some pieces of marble in a container at
760 mm Hg pressure is 100 mL. If the pressure is
changed to 1000 mm Hg, the new volume is 80 mL.
Find the volume occupied by the marble pieces, if the
temperature remains constant.

Solution : Let the volume occupied by the marble
pieces = V mL
At 760 mm Hg, the volume occupied by the
gas = (100 - V) mL
At 1000 mm Hg, the volume occupied by the
gas = (80 — V) mL
By Boyle’s law, P,|V, = P,V,
. 760 x (100 - V) = 1000 x (80 ~ V)
or 24V = 400 mL
or V = 16-6 mL

(Ans. 1800 mm of Hg)

7.6 TEMPERATURE-VOLUME RELATIONSHIP
IN GASES
This relationship is seen easily when an inflated
balloon, is left in bright sun and it bursts. This is
because the air inside the balloon expands with the
rise in temperature.

In general, an increase in temperature at
constant pressure causes an increase in volume;
and a decrease in temperature at constant pressure
causes a decrease in volume.

In 1787, Jacques Charles studied the temperature-
volume relationship of gases. His work was further
extended by Joseph Gay-Lussac in 1802.

Experimentally, it was found that a fixed mass
of any gas expands or contracts respectively by
1/273 of its volume at 0 °C for each degree Celsius
rise or fall in temperature, provided the pressure
remains constant.

Charles’s law :
Pressure remaining constant, the volume of a given

mass of a dry gas increases or decreases by 1/273 of
its volume at 0°C for each I°C increase or decrease
in temperature respectively.

Mathematical expression of Charles’s law

Let V, be the volume of a fixed mass of a gas
at 0 °C, and let V be its volume at temperature
t °C at constant pressure. Then, according to
Charles’s law,

= Yo
V=Vyt+ 573 t (when P is constant)

V= 573 F where T = 273 +t

For a given mass of a gas,

Charles’s law may be restated as : Volume of a

given mass of a dry gas is directly proportional to

its absolute (Kelvin) temperature, if the pressure
remains constant.

This is called the Charles’s law equation.
According to this equation :

(i) if the temperature is doubled, the volume would
be doubled.
(ii) if it is reduced by half, the volume would also
be reduced by half.
Graphical representation of Charles’s law :

The relationship between volume and temperature
of a gas can be plotted on a graph, as shown in
Fig. 7.5. A straight line is obtained.

The general term isobar (constant pressure) is
assigned to such graphs.

relationship in a gas (at constant pressure)

7.6.1 Explanation of Charles’s law in terms of
molecular motion (kinetic theory).

According to the kinetic theory of gases,
the average kinetic energy of gas particles (molecules)
is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.
Thus, when the temperature of a gas is increased,
the particles (molecules) would move faster
(kinetic energy is the energy by virtue of its
motion), and will strike the walls of the container
more frequently and vigorously. If the pressure is kept
constant, volume increases proportionately. Hence, at
constant pressure, volume of a given mass of a gas
is directly proportional to temperature (CHARLES’S
LAW).

7.6.2 Significance of Charles’s law

Volume of a given mass of a gas is directly
proportional to its temperature, hence density
decreases with an increase in temperature. This is
the reason why hot air is filled into balloons used
for meteorological purposes.

7.7 ABSOLUTE ZERO

From equation (1) V = V, (ee)

273 —273
Volume at -—273°C = Vo (a) =

Thus, it can be concluded that the volume of a
gas would be reduced to zero at —273°C.

According to Lord Kelvin, if temperature of an
enclosed gas at 0°C is lowered to —273°C, its
volume becomes zero. However, this is not possible,
because gas is one of the states of matter and hence,
must have some definite mass and volume.

The temperature -—273°C is called absolute
zero. All gases liquefy or solidify before reaching
this temperature.

Theoretically, this is the lowest temperature that
can ever be reached. At this temperature, all
molecular motions cease. However, practically
speaking, this temperature is impossible to attain.

7.8 ABSOLUTE OR KELVIN SCALE OF
TEMPERATURE
The temperature scale with its zero
at -273-15°C (for convenience in calculations, ~
273°C is used) and whose each degree is equal to
one degree on the Celsius scale, is called the Kelvin
or absolute scale of temperature.

7.9 CONVERSION OF TEMPERATURE FROM

The value on the Celsius scale can be converted to

~ 20°C = 20+ 273 = 293K
27°C = 27 + 273 = 300K
~ 273°C =~ 273 +273 =0K

Kelvin scale values can be converted to degree
Celsius values by subtracting 273 from it.

0 K = 0 - 273 = -273°C

273 K = 273 — 273 = 0°C (freezing point of water

7.10 THE GAS EQUATION (PRESSURE,
VOLUME AND TEMPERATURE
RELATIONSHIP)

If both pressure and temperature of a fixed
mass of a gas are varied, a combination of Boyle’s
and Charles’s laws gives us a fixed relation
amongst its volume, pressure and temperature.

1
According to Boyle’s law, V < >

and according to Charles’s law, V «< T

Now, on combining the two laws, volume of a
given mass of a gas varies inversely with pressure
and directly with absolute temperature.

1
Ve— xT
“Pp
T
or V= P x constant
PV
or rT = constant

Accordingly, if the volume of a given mass of

a gas changes from V, to V,, its pressure from P, to
P,, and its temperature from 7, to T,, then

PV,  P,V,
TY 7,

The above mathematical expression is called the
gas equation. This equation is used for calculating
changes in gas volume when both its pressure and
temperature change.

7.11 STANDARD TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE

(S.T.P.)

Since volume of a gas changes remarkably
with change in temperature and pressure, it
becomes necessary to choose standard values of
temperature and pressure to which gas volumes
can be referred.

The standard values chosen are 0°C or 273K
for temperature, and 1 atmospheric unit (atm) or
760 mm Hg for pressure. These standard values are
known as standard temperature and pressure
(S.T.P.).

Remember :
Standard temperature = 0 °C = 273 K
Standard pressure = 760 mm Hg

= 76 cm Hg
= 1 atm.

Any change in pressure or temperature is likely
to change the volume of a gas. Thus, while expressing
the specific volume of a gas, it is necessary to specify
both its pressure and its temperature.

Note : By increasing pressure on the volume of
an enclosed gas, its volume decreases, whereas by
increasing temperature, its volume increases. Thus,
by keeping equilibrium between an increase in
pressure and an increase in temperature, it is
possible to keep the volume constant.

7.12 THE EFFECT OF MOISTURE ON PRESSURE

Certain gases, like nitrogen and hydrogen are
collected over water as shown in the Fig. 7.7.
When the gas is collected over water, it is moist
and contains water vapour. The total pressure
exerted by this moist gas is equal to the sum of

the partial pressures* of the dry gas and the pressure
exerted by water vapour. Partial pressure of water
vapour is also known as aqueous tension.
