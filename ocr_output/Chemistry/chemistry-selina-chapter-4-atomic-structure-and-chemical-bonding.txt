INTRODUCTION
Many attempts have been made to know as to what
is the ultimate particle of matter. The idea of the smallest
unit of matter was first given by Maharshi Kanada in
the 6th Century B.C. in India. According to him, matter
consisted of indestructible minute particles called
paramanus (param means ultimate and anu means
particle) now called atoms”. A paramanu does not exist
in free state, rather it combines with other paramanus
to form a bigger particle called anu (now known as a
molecule). There are different types of paramanus. Each
one of them exhibits specific properties.
The Greek philosopher Democritus (460 B.C.
— 370 B.C.) called the paramanu an “atom”, which
comes from the Greek word, meaning indivisible. But
the first scientific theory about the structure of matter
was given by John Dalton (in 1808). It considered
atoms as indivisible particles that are the fundamental
building blocks of matter. The existence of different
types of matter is considered to be due to different
types of atoms constituting them.
The main postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory are:
1. Matter consists of very small and indivisible
particles called atoms.
2. Atoms can neither be created nor be destroyed.
3. The atoms of an element are alike in all respects
but they differ from the atoms of other elements.
4. Atoms of an element combine in small numbers
to form molecules.

5. Atoms of one element combine with atoms of
another element in a simple ratio to form
molecules of compounds.

6. Atoms are the smallest units of matter that can take
part in a chemical reaction.

Note : The latest research on atoms has proved that
most of the postulates of Dalton’s atomic theory are

incorrect except that atoms take part in chemical
reactions.

One of the first indications that atoms consist of
subatomic particles, i.e. they are made up of charged
particles has been put forward by the studies of static
electricity* and the conditions under which
electricity is conducted by different substances. In
1833, Faraday showed that the flow of electricity is
due to the flow of charged particles. GJ. Stoney (in
1874) first suggested the name electron for this
electrical particle. However, it was J. J. Thomson who
showed the existence of these charged particles and
thus discovered electrons, negatively charged
particles. E. Goldstein, a German scientist discovered
protons, positively charged particles in atom. Later
on, James Chadwick discovered neutrons. The
electrons, protons and neutrons are called the
fundamental particles of an atom. These particles are
the building blocks of all atoms of an element.

* Electrification of objects by rubbing with each other is
called static electricity or frictional electricity.

4.1 DEFINITION OF AN ELEMENT

An element is a substance which is made up
of only one type of atoms.

Element is a pure substance that can neither
be decomposed into, nor formed from simple

substances by ordinary physical or chemical
methods. .

For example : Carbon is an element because it
cannot be split up into two or more simpler
substances by ordinary methods like heating, breaking
or passing electricity.

Note : Radioactivity* the processes of radioactive
decay and high energy nuclear reaction can transfer
one elementary substance into another.

4.2 DEFINITION OF AN ATOM

“An atom is the smallest particle of an element
that exhibits all the properties of that element. It may
or may not exist independently but takes part in every
chemical reaction.

Example : Take a small piece of zinc and
grind it into smaller pieces. All these pieces show
properties of zinc. On grinding them further they
break up into very fine particles which still show
the properties of zinc. But, there comes a stage
when the particles cannot be further subdivided
into particles exhibiting properties of zinc. These
indivisible particles are the atoms of zinc.

“In other words an atom is the smallest possible
unit of an element”.

4.3, CONSTITUENTS OF AN ATOM
Discovery of electrons

William Crooke, a British scientist, noted that
gases are ordinarily poor conductors of electricity.
However, when a high voltage (10,000 volts)
charge from an induction coil is applied to tubes
filled with gases at very low pressure (0.01 mm Hg),
the gases become good conductors of electricity
and begin to flow from cathode to anode in the
form of rays. Since these rays originate from the
negative plate, i.e. the cathode and travel from
the cathode towards the anode, they are called
cathode rays.

* The phenomenon due to which certain elements spontaneously
emit highly penetrating rays called radiation.

Later J.J. ‘Uhomson Studied the characteristics
and the constituents of cathode rays. The apparatus
used by him is called a discharge tube or a
cathode ray tube shown in Fig. 4.1.

PUMP

INDUCTION COIL

Fig. 4.1 Discharge tube with flowing electrons

A discharge tube is a hard glass tube fitted with
two metal plates known as electrodes, one of which
is connected to the positive terminal of battery and
is called anode (positive electrode) while the other
electrode which is connected to the negative terminal
of the battery is called cathode (negative electrode).
It has a side tube through which gas can be pumped
out by using a vacuum pump to create vacuum.

When electrical discharge of 10,000 volts
is passed through gases at very low pressures
(0-01 mm), cathode rays are produced.

Properties of Cathode Rays

1. They travel from the cathode to the anode in
straight lines.

2. They cause a greenish yellow fluorescence on
a soda-glass screen placed in the tube.

3. They are affected by electric field, i.e. they are
inflected towards the positive field and
deflected from the negative field. This shows
that they carry negative charge. (Fig. 4.2).

NEGATIVELY CHARGED PLATE

INDUCTION COIL
Fig. 4.2 Deflection of cathode rays.


--- Page 3 ---
4. When a beam of cathode rays is made to fall
upon hard metallic targets like tungsten, X-rays
are produced.

5. They penetrate through matter.

6. They cause ionization of the gas through which
they pass. )

7. The ratio of the charge(e) to mass(m) of the
particles constituting cathode rays remains the
same (e/m = 1-76 x 10"! coulomb/kg) irrespective
of the nature of the gas taken and of the metal
forming the cathode.

8. They produce the shadow of an opaque object
placed in their path and make a light paddle wheel
rotate.

Thomson concluded that :
(i) cathode rays consist of negatively charged

particles, now called electrons.
[The name ‘electron,’ meaning ‘atom of negative
electricity,’ was given by Johnson Stoney].

(ii) these negatively-charged particles are an integral
part of all atoms.

(iii) electrons have both definite mass and definite
electric charge, both of which are independent
of the nature of the gas in the discharge tube.

Properties of Electrons

1. Electrons from all sources are alike, having
identical mass.

2. They are a constituent part of all atoms.

3. The mass of an electron is 1/1837 the mass of a
hydrogen atom (or 9-108 x 10?! kg).

4. An electron carries unit negative charge of
magnitude —1-602 x 107’? coulombs.

5. The electron is extremely small; its radius is less
than 1 x 10-5 m.

An electron may be defined as a subatomic particle
having a unit negative charge and a mass equal to
1/1837 of hydrogen atom. It is denoted by the
symbol _,e°. The superscript 0 represents its mass and
subscript —1 represents its electrical charge.
Atoms are found to be electrically neutral, so
they must contain, in addition, particles that are
positively charged, such that the total negative
charge of the electrons is equal to the total
positive charge. This realization led to the discovery
of positively charged subatomic particles protons.

Note : When a high voltage current is passed
through a gas taken in the discharge tube, electrical
energy breaks up the atoms of the gas into
negatively charged particles (electrons) and
positively charged particles (protons) are formed
by the removal of one or more electrons from
the gaseous atoms.

4.4. DISCOVERY OF PROTONS

Goldstein noticed another set of rays travelling
in a direction opposite to that of the cathode rays,
i.e. from anode towards cathode, when a perforated
cathode was used in the above discharge tube
(shown in Fig. 4.3). He called these rays as canal
rays since these rays passed through holes or
‘canals’ in the cathode. These rays were named as
positive rays or anode rays.

Fig. 4.3 Production of anode rays

Properties of Anode Rays
1. Anode rays travel in a straight line.

2. They consist of minute material particles and
hence produce mechanical effects.

3. They are made up of positively charged
particles.

4. Positive rays are deflected by electric and
magnetic fields but in a direction opposite to
that of the cathode rays. This means that
these rays consist of positively charged
particles called the protons.

5. These rays produce fluorescence on a zinc
sulphide screen.

6. Their e/m i.e. charge to mass ratio, differs from
gas to gas. Its value is much less than that of
an electron and is maximum when hydrogen is
taken in the discharge tube.


--- Page 4 ---
Proton may be defined as a subatomic
particle having mass 1 amu, i.e. equal to
hydrogen atom and has unit positive charge.

It is denoted as _,P', the superscript 1
represents its mass 1 amu and the subscript +1
represents one unit positive charge.

Proton is formed by the loss of an electron
from a hydrogen atom.

H - e&

(proton)

Properties of Protons

1. A proton possesses a unit positive charge +1
(plus one) of the value 1-602 x 10° coulombs.

2. Its mass is the same as that of a hydrogen
atom (1 a.m.u., i.e., 1837 times the mass of an
electron, which is 1-672 x 10-4 g).

3. The proton resides in the central part of an
atom, i.e. in the nucleus.

After the discovery of electrons and protons
J.J. Thomson proposed ‘plum pudding’ model of
the atom.

According to this model :

1. An atom is considered to be a sphere of

uniform positive charge and electrons are
embedded into it.

2. The total positive charge is equal to the total
negative charge so that an atom as a whole is
electrically neutral.

3. The mass of an atom is considered to be
uniformly distributed.

4.55 DISCOVERY OF NUCLEUS

In 1911, Lord Rutherford, a scientist from
New Zealand, directed a stream of alpha-particles*

* An a-particle is a doubly charged helium ion He?t, containing
two protons and two neutrons. It is formed by removing 2 electrons
from helium atom.

towards a very thin (one millionth of a centimetre)
gold foil. He selected a gold foil because he wanted
as thin a layer as possible and gold is the most
malleable metal.

He observed that :

(1) Most of the alpha particles passed straight
through the foil.

(2) Some alpha particles were slightly
deflected from their straight path.

(3) Very few (nearly one in ten thousand)
alpha particles were either deflected by
very large angles or completely bounced
back.

Later, Rutherford generalised these results
of alpha particles scattering experiment and
suggested a model of the atom that is known as
Rutherford’s Atomic Model.

Note : Heavy metals such as platinum will
show the same observation with alpha (a) particles
as shown by gold foil, but if light nuclei like
lithium is used then fast moving o-particles
may even push the light nucleus aside and may not
be deflected back.



--- Page 5 ---
4.5.1 Rutherford’s atomic model
According to this model :

1.

nN

The atom contains a large empty space (extra-
nuclear space). This is why most of the
Q-particles pass through the metal foil without
deviating from their path.

. There is a positively charged mass at the

centre of the atom, known as the nucleus, in
which the entire mass of the atom is
concentrated. Therefore, the nucleus is the
densest part of the atom. The electrically
positive nature of the nucleus is supported by
the fact that the positively charged o-particles
approaching the nucleus get deflected. This
proved that the nucleus contained protons.

. The size of the nucleus is very small

compared to the size of an atom. This is
proved by the fact that most of the o-particles
pass straight through the gold foil.

. The electrons revolve around the nucleus at

large distances from each other and from
nucleus (in circular orbits found in the empty
space of the atom).

. An atom as a whole is electrically neutral,

because the total positive charge of the nucleus
is balanced by the total negative charge of the
electrons, i.e., the number of protons and
electrons in an atom are equal.

. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in

close circular paths (ORBITS). The force
of attraction between the negatively charged

ELECTRONS

Fig. 4.6 Rutherford’s model of the atom was somewhat
like that of the solar system

electrons and the positively charged nucleus is
counter balanced by the centrifugal force
acquired by the revolving electrons.

Rutherford’s model of atomic structure is similar
to the structure of the solar system. Just as in the solar
system, the Sun is at the centre (having the maximum
mass) and the planets revolve around it, similarly in
an atom the nucleus contains the main mass and the
electrons revolve around it in orbits or shells.

4.5.2 Drawback of Rutherford’s atomic model

The comparison of electrons with planets in
the solar system is the main drawback of
Rutherford’s atomic model. According to the
classical laws of mechanics and electrodynamics, if
an electrically charged particle is in motion, it
inevitably radiates energy. Thus, an electron, when
moving round the nucleus continually, should
radiate energy, i.e. loses energy. As a result, it
should be gradually pulled towards the nucleus and
end up colliding with it. This should result in the
total collapse of the atom (Fig. 4.7).

NEGATIVELY CHARGED
ELECTRON

POSITIVELY CHARGED
NUCLEUS

Fig. 4.7 Showing an atom losing energy

If it was so, the atom should be highly
unstable and hence matter would not exist in the
form that we know. However, we know that an
atom is structurally stable.

Thus Rutherford’s model failed to explain
the stability of an atom.

4.6 BOHR’S ATOMIC MODEL

In 1913, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist,
explained the causes of the stability of the atom in
a different manner.

Main postulates of Bohr’s atomic model
(1) The electrons revolving around the nucleus are

confined to certain fixed orbits called shells or


--- Page 6 ---
energy levels, each of which is associated with
a fixed amount of energy.

(2) While it is revolving around the nucleus in an
orbit, an electron neither loses nor gains energy.

(3) An electron revolving in a particular orbit, on
gaining a certain amount of energy, jumps to
the next orbit and vice versa. Since each orbit
is associated with a fixed amount of energy,
Bohr called it an energy level.

For convenience, these energy levels are labelled
K, L, M, N or I, I, III, IV, etc. The orbit closest to
the nucleus is the K shell. It has the least amount of
energy and the electrons present in it are called K
electrons, and so on with the successive shells and
their electrons.

4.7 DISCOVERY OF NEUTRONS
By now we know that an atom contains
electrons and protons, and that the atomic mass of
an electron is negligible. Therefore, an atom of
helium, which contains 2 protons should have a
mass = 2 x | a.m.u. = 2 a.m.u.

But the atomic mass of a helium atom was found
to be approximately 4-0 a.m.u. It was, therefore,

proposed that, in the nucleus of an atom, there
must be another particle. This particle should not
possess any electrical charge and must be equal in
mass to the proton.

In 1932 Chadwick discovered these particles
by bombarding light nuclei like beryllium with
*alpha (a) particles i.e. helium nuclei.

Be? + ,He* (a) > .C? + gn!
(neutron)

These particles are found to be neutral, so

named neutrons.

4

A neutron is a sub-atomic particle or fundamental
particle of an atom with no charge and mass
almost equal to the mass of the proton i.e.

hydrogen atom. Neutron is denoted by gn!. The
superscript 1 represents its mass and subscript 0
represents its electrical charge.

Properties of Neutrons
1. This particle was not found to be deflected by
any magnetic or electric field, proving that it
is electrically neutral.
2.Its mass is equal to 1-676 x 10-4 g (1 amu).

After the discovery of electrons, protons and

neutrons (subatomic particles) it was found that

all atoms have a similar following basic structure.

¢ Electrons are negatively charged particles that
are found outside the nucleus.

¢ Protons are positively charged particles that
are found in the nucleus of an atom.

¢ Neutrons are electrically neutral particles that
are also found in the nucleus. Neutrons are

slightly heavier than protons.

(i) Atoms are indivisible particles.

(ii) Atoms can neither be created nor destroyed.

(iii) The atoms of an element are alike in all respects,
but they differ from the atoms of other elements.

(iv) Atoms follow the laws of chemical combination

Atoms are divisible into sub-atomic particles

The atoms of an element may not be alike in all
respects, as is seen in the case of isotopes.

In the formation of organic compounds, the laws of
chemical combination are not always followed.

4.8 ATOM — ITS STRUCTURE

The atom is built up of a number of sub-atomic
particles*. The three sub-atomic particles of great
importance in understanding the structure of an atom
are electrons, protons and neutrons, the properties of
which are given in Table 4.2.

There are two structural parts of an atom, the

imaginary paths called orbits.

(contains protons and neutrons)

Fig. 4.9 Showing structure of an atom

* Modern theories about the atom include the existence of over
200 subatomic particles such as positron, neutrino, etc.

Nucleus The protons and neutrons
[collectively called nucleons] are found in the
central part or nucleus of the atom.

Orbits : It is the imaginary path where electrons
revolve around the nucleus of the atom.

4.9 ATOMIC NUMBER [Z]

« An atom of an element has its own
characteristic number of protons in its nucleus,
which distinguishes it from the atoms of other
elements.

¢ This characteristic number (number of protons)
is called the atomic number of the element.

¢ Atomic number is denoted by Z.

¢ The atomic number is, therefore, equal to the
number of electrons in the atom of an element
as well, since in a neutral atom,

no. of protons = no. of electrons.

¢« Number of protons gives the total positive
charge present in the nucleus of an atom.

The atomic number of an element is the number of :

* protons present in the nucleus of its atom.

¢ electrons present in its neutral atom.

* positive charge in the nucleus of its atom.

DISTRIBUTION OF ELECTRONS IN THE
ORBITS — BOHR-BURY SCHEME

Distribution of electrons in different shells is called |
electronic configuration.

Distribution of electrons into different shells
(orbits) of an atom was suggested by Bohr and Bury.

4.10

The following rules are followed for writing
the number of electrons in different energy levels
or shells.

1. The maximum possible number of electrons
in a particular shell is given by the formula 2n?,
where n denotes the serial number of that shell.

First or K shell has (2 x 12) = 2 electrons
Second or L shell has (2 x 22) = 8 electrons
Third or M shell has (2 x 32) = 18 electrons
Fourth or N shell has (2 x 42) = 32 electrons
and so on.

2. Electrons are not accomodated in a given shell,
unless the inner shells are filled. In other words
the shells are filled in stepwise manner.

3. The outermost shell of an atom cannot
accommodate more than 8 electrons, even if it
has the capacity to accommodate more electrons.
For example electronic arrangement in Calcium
having 20 electrons is

K L M N
2 8 8 2

Atomic number [Z]}

{ = no. of protons [p]
= no. of electrons {e]

Mass Number [A]

Mass number [A]
= no. of neutrons (n] + no. of protons [p]

~A=n+p
[-: p=Z) -. no. of neutrons [n] = A - Z

Atomic number [Z] =p =e = 17
Mass number
No. of neutrons ([n] =A-Z= 18

[A] =n+p=35

The maximum capacity of M shell is
18 electrons but only 8 electrons are filled in it.
This is due to the fact that the elements
become stable only after acquiring 8 electrons
in the outermost shell.

4. The outermost shell of a chemically stable
atom can accommodate a maximum of 8
electrons, except Helium atom, which has only
one shell, and can thus accommodate a
maximum of 2 electrons only.

Structure of Magnesium atom

Magnesium has atomic
number 12 and atomic mass 24.
Hence its nucleus has 12 protons
and (24 — 12) = 12 neutrons. It is
surrounded by 12 electrons that Fig. 4.10 The structure
are allotted to different shells as oF the magnesium atom
follows.

K shell or I shell = 2 electrons
L shell or II shell = 8 electrons
M shell or III shell = 2 electrons

So its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2.

In lighter elements, up to argon (atomic number
18), each inner shell is completely filled before any
electron can occupy an outer shell. However, in
elements heavier than argon, the situation changes.
Although the third shell can accommodate up to
18 electrons, yet the fourth shell begins to be filled
after it has only 8 electrons.

For example, potassium (atomic number 19)
has 19 electrons. Its electronic configuration is :

K L M N

Main features of the structure of atoms :

(i) Atoms of all the elements (except hydrogen) are made up of three fundamental (sub-atomic)
particles: electrons, protons and neutrons. (Hydrogen atom lacks neutrons).

(ii) The nucleus is located at the centre of the atom. It contains protons and neutrons, which account
for the total mass of that atom.

(iii) The nucleus is positively charged due to the presence of protons in it.

(iv) The electrons are outside the nucleus and have negligible mass.

(v) The number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protons in it, hence the atom is
electrically neutral.

(vi) The electrons revolve rapidly in fixed circular paths around the nucleus. These circular paths are
called energy levels or shells or orbits.

(vii) The atoms of different elements contain different numbers of electrons, protons and neutrons.

4.11 VALENCE ELECTRONS

The outermost shell of an atom is called
its valence shell, and the electrons present in the
valence shell are known as valence electrons.

Hydrogen has only one electron in its valence
shell, hence it has one valence electron. Similarly,
carbon has 4 electrons in the valence shell and so it
has 4 valence electrons.

The chemical properties of elements are
decided by these valence electrons, since they
are the ones that take part in chemical reactions.

The elements with the same number of electrons
in the valence shell show similar properties; those with
different number of valence electrons show different
chemical properties.

Elements, which have valence electrons 1 or 2
or 3 (except hydrogen), are metals.

These elements can lose electrons to form ions*
which are positively charged and are called CATIONS.

eg. Na - e —- Nat
2, 8, 1 2, 8

* Anion is an electrically charged atom or group of atoms formed
by loss or gain of electrons.

@) " @)

They are good reducing agents.

Elements with 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 electrons in their
valence shells are non-metals.

These elements can gain electrons to form ions
which are negatively charged and are called
ANIONS.

They are good oxidising agents.

> Ch
2, 8,8


--- Page 12 ---
Elements with the valence shell having
8 electrons, and helium with 2 electrons, cannot
gain or loose electrons so they are chemically

inactive and are called inert gases or noble gases.

Valency of an element is the combining capacity
of that element with other elements and is equal to the
number of electrons that take part in a chemical reaction.

Valency of the elements having 1, 2 or 3 valence
electrons is 1, 2 or 3 respectively while valency of
elements with 4, 5, 6 and 7 valence electrons is 4, 3,
2 and | (8 minus valence electrons) respectively.
4.12 REASON FOR CHEMICAL ACTIVITY OF

AN ATOM

Atoms of all noble gases (except Helium) have
eight electrons in their outermost shell. This
arrangement is known as OCTET (Table 4.4).

Table 4.4. Electronic configuration of the
inert or rare gases.

gas No.
He

Ne
Ar
Kr
Xe
Rn

Among all the elements, only six inert gases
(also called noble or rare gases), namely, Helium
(He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon
(Xe) and Radon (Rn), are non-reactive, i.e. inert. They
do not combine with other atoms to form molecules,
since their outermost shells are already filled. So their
combining capacity or valency is zero.

Helium has 2 electrons [duplet] in its shell (K
shell), which can occupy a maximum of 2 electrons
(according to the 2n’ rule). So it is a stable
element, even though the 8-electron rule does not
apply in its case.

Thus the chemical activity of an atom depends
upon the number of electrons in the valence shell of
its atom. Chemically active atoms have an
incomplete octet, i.e. less than 8 electrons or less than
2 electrons (in case of hydrogen) in their valence
shell. The valence electrons of atoms contribute to
the formation of molecules.

Miran’

Why do atoms combine ?

Kossel and Lewis, in 1916, independently put
forward the octet theory of valency or the
electronic theory of valency. According to
them, the rare gases have a stable electronic
configuration.

The atoms of all elements, other than the inert
gases, combine because they have incomplete

valence shells and tend to attain a stable
configuration.

Elements tend to combine with one another to
attain the stable electronic configuration of the nearest
inert gas, i.e. 8 electrons in its valence shell. This is
known as OCTET RULE. However, in the case of
helium, valence shell has 2 electrons and this is known
as DUPLET RULE.

This is achieved either by gaining electrons or
losing electrons or sharing of electrons with other
atoms of same element or another element.

The number of electrons gained, lost or shared to
attain the octet in the outermost shell, gives the

combining capacity of the element that is, its
valency.

As a result of this redistribution of electrons, a
force of attraction develops between atoms, which
binds them together to form molecules. This force
is known as a chemical bond.

A chemical bond may be defined as the force of

attraction between the two atoms that binds them
together as a unit called molecule.

The chemical combination of atoms involves
redistribution of electrons so as to leave each atom
with a stable electronic configuration.

4.13 ISOTOPES

It is noticed that two atoms of the same element
contain the same number of protons but they may
differ in the number of neutrons. However, electrons,
protons and neutrons are arranged in the same way and
give the atoms identical chemical properties. An
element showing similar chemical properties but
possessing different mass is said to represent ISOTOPY
and the varieties of the atom are called ISOTOPES.

Isotopes may be defined as atoms of the same

nnn

element having the same atomic number but
different mass numbers.

Structures of the isotopes
1. Hydrogen

Hydrogen has three isotopes, namely protium,
deuterium (or heavy hydrogen) and tritium, each
having the same atomic number, i.e. 1 but different
mass numbers, i.e. 1, 2 and 3 respectively. In other
words, isotopes differ only in their number of
neutrons. Thus, protium has no neutron, deuterium
has one and tritium has two neutrons (Fig. 4.11). They

are represented as |H and 7H and ?H respectively,
in which the subscript denotes the atomic number and
the superscript the mass number.

represented by the symbols ?C, @C and ?C
respectively. (Fig. 4.12)

3. Chlorine

The two isotopes of chlorine, of mass numbers
35 and 37 respectively, have the same atomic number
(17), ie. the same number of protons and electrons.
However, they differ only with respect to the number
of neutrons contained in their respective nuclei. They
are represented as }3Cl and //Cl. Isotope Cl

has 35 — 17 = 18 neutrons, and isotope ;/ Cl has
37 — 17 = 20 neutrons, (See Fig. 4.13).

Properties of Isotopes
Isotopes have similar chemical properties.

Isotopes have the same atomic number (Z), ie.
the same number of electrons and protons and hence
the same electronic configuration. Chemical properties
are determined by the electronic configuration of an
atom. Thus, isotopes of an element are chemically
alike. For example : The chlorine atom of mass
number 37 undergoes the same reactions as the
chlorine atom of mass number 35.

Isotopes differ in few physical properties
such as density, boiling point etc.

Physical constants or physical properties
depend on the atomic mass (mass number) and
isotopes have different mass numbers (A) due to
different number of neutrons.

For example, the boiling point of protium (H})
is 20-38 K and that of deuterium 7H) is 23-5 K.
Thus, the higher the mass of the isotope of an
element, the higher is the boiling point.

Isotopes like tritium, carbon-14 illustrate
another difference in physical properties that can
occur between isotopes as they are radioactive. The
extra neutrons in their nuclei cause them to be


--- Page 14 ---
unstable so the nuclei break up spontaneously
emitting certain types of radiation. Thus carbon-14
and tritium (7H) are known as radio-isotopes.

The spontaneous decay of unstable
radioisotopes is known as radioactivity.

Uses of isotopes
1. Isotope of cobalt 8°Co is used in radiotherapy
for treating cancer and other diseases.
2. 4c is used for determining the age of
historical and geological material.

3. An isotope of Uranium 735U is used as a fuel
in nuclear reactors.

4. An isotope of Iodine '3)I is used in the
treatment of goitre.

Fractional atomic masses

An atom can have a fractional atomic mass. For
example, the atomic mass of chlorine is 35-5. The
reason for fractional atomic mass is that the atomic
mass of an element represents the weighted average

of all the naturally occurring isotopes of that
element.

For example, any natural sample of chlorine
contains 75% of Cl and 25% #7Cl, ie. these
isotopes are in the ratio of 3 : 1 respectively. Thus,
average atomic mass of chlorine is calculated as

35x3+37xl

4.14 ELECTROVALENT (OR IONIC) BOND

Atoms of metallic elements that have 1, 2 or 3 valence
electrons can lose electron(s) to atoms of non-metallic
elements, which have 5, 6 or 7 electrons respectively in
their outermost shell and thereby forming an electrovalent
compound.

After the transfer of electron(s), both the
combining atoms acquire the electronic configuration
of the nearest inert gas.

A metallic atom, which loses electron(s), becomes
a positively charged ion and is known as a cation
and a non-metallic atom, which gains electron(s),
becomes a negatively charged ion and is known as an
anion.

An ion is a charged particle which is formed due to the
gain or the loss of one or more electrons by an atom.

A metallic element, whose one atom readily loses
electron(s) to form a positively charged ion, is an
electropositive element.

Na -—e — Nat (cation)

A non-metallic element, whose atom readily
accepts electron(s) to form a negatively charged ion,
is an electronegative element.

Cl + e- — Cr (anion)

The cation and the anion being oppositely
charged attract each other and form a chemical bond.
Since this chemical bond formation is due to the
electrostatic force of attraction between a cation and an
anion, it is called an electrovalent (or an tonic) bond.

Electrovalent (or ionic) compounds : The chemical
compounds formed as a result of the transfer of electrons
from one atom of an element to one atom of another

element are called ionic (or electrovalent) compounds.
Electrovalency : The number of electrons that an atom
of an element loses or gains to form a electrovalent bond
is called its electrovalency.

The metals of group numbers 1, 2 and 13 have
a tendency to lose their valence electrons. So they
combine with the non-metals of Groups 15, 16 and
17, which have a tendency to gain electron(s) and
form ionic bonds.

Note : Group 1 elements are most electropositive, i.e.,
they are metallic in nature. Their metallic nature increases
down the group, so caesium is most electropositive.

Group 17 elements are most electronegative.

Fluorine is the most electronegative element. Thus,
caesium fluoride CsF is the most ionic compound.

Bonds formed between metals and non-metals are
ionic or electrovalent bonds.

Why are Ionic Compounds Stable?

Ionic compounds are formed by ions but there
also exists a repulsive force between ions for like
charges. Since the electrostatic force of attraction
between opposite charges is much higher, it makes
the ionic compounds stable.

Examples of electrovalent (ionic) compounds.

NaCl (Sodium chloride)
MgCl, (Magnesium chloride)
CaO (Calcium oxide)

KBr (Potassium Bromide)
CaCl, (Calcium chloride)

4.14.1 Structures of some electrovalent compounds

1. Sodium chloride (NaCl)

The electronic configuration of a sodium atom
is 2, 8, 1. It has one electron in excess of the stable
electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, neon,
(2, 8). Therefore, an atom of sodium shows a tendency
to give up the electron from its outermost shell, so as
to acquire a stable electronic configuration of neon.

Na — Na* + Ile
(2, 8, 1) (2, 8)
atom cation

However, after giving up one electron, the
sodium atom is no more electrically neutral. It has
eleven protons in its nucleus but only ten electrons
revolving around it. Therefore, it has a net positive
charge of +1. This positively charged atom is called
sodium ion and is written as Na* and its electronic
configuration resembles that of the noble gas neon.

The electronic configuration of chlorine is 2, 8, 7.
It has an electronic configuration with one electron less
than that of the nearest noble gas, argon (2, 8, 8).
Therefore, the chlorine atom shows a tendency to
acquire an electron to attain octet in its outermost shell.

Cl + le 73 Cr
(2, 8, 7) (2, 8, 8)
atom anion

An atom of chlorine is electrically neutral, as it
contains 17 protons in its nucleus and 17 electrons
revolving around it. But, after acquiring an electron

————— $6


--- Page 17 ---
from the sodium atom, the chlorine atom does not
remain electrically neutral. It has one electron more
than the number of protons in its nucleus and therefore
has charge of -1 represented as Cr i.e. chloride ion.

Chloride ion has an octet of electrons in its
outermost shell, and its electronic configuration
resembles that of the noble gas argon (Fig. 4.14).

Thus, when an atom of sodium combines with an
atom of chlorine (electronic configuration 2, 8,7), one
electron is transferred from the sodium atom to the
chlorine atom, resulting in the formation of a sodium
chloride molecule.

The cation Na+ and anion Cl- are attracted

ionic compound.

Electron dot symbol (Lewis symbol)

The electron dot symbol for an atom consists of
the symbol of the element surrounded by dots
representing the outermost shell electrons. The
paired electrons are represented by a pair of dots,
whereas the unpaired electron in the outermost orbit
is represented by a single dot.

Example : Electron dot symbol of Hydrogen is H*

and of Oxygen is :O;
Symbols other than dots, such as circles and crosses
can be used to distinguish between the electrons of
different atoms in a molecule,

for example :
Ammonia (NH3) can be represented as

2. Magnesium chloride (MgCl,)

The number of valence electrons of magnesium
(atomic number 12) is 2 and that of chlorine (atomic
number 17) is 7. Magnesium atom, acquires a stable
configuration of 8 electrons by losing two electrons
from its outermost shell (one each to each atom of
chlorine) and thus becomes a positive magnesium ion,

However, each chlorine atom, which contains
7 electrons in its outermost shell, can accept only 1 of
the 2 electrons donated by a magnesium atom.
Therefore, for each magnesium atom forming a
magnesium ion, there must be two chlorine atoms to
form two chloride ions.

3. Calcium oxide (CaO)

The number of valence electrons of a calcium
atom (atomic number 20) is 2, and that of an
oxygen atom is 6, i.e., oxygen requires 2 electrons
to attain octet. In the presence of oxygen, each
calcium atom loses its 2 valence electrons to one
oxygen atom (Fig. 4.15). As a result, the calcium
atom forms a calcium ion with charge +2 (Ca”*),
and the oxygen atom forms an oxide ion with
charge —2 (O*). Since only one oxygen atom is
needed to accept the 2 valence electrons donated
by a calcium atom, the formula of calcium oxide
is CaO and not Ca,O,.

cave “G8 — Ca2+ [:o3]”

In the formation of an electrovalent bond,
the transfer of electron(s) is involved. The
electropositive atom undergoes oxidation, while the
electronegative atom undergoes reduction. This is
known as REDOX PROCESS.

For example :

Formation of sodium chloride : Sodium
chloride is formed by the combination of sodium
and chlorine.

2Na + Cl, — 2Na* + 2Cr (or 2 NaCl)
The reaction can be written as two half

Reduction
Oxidation and reduction always occur
simultaneously because the electron(s) lost by the
reducing agent must be gained by the oxidising
agent.
For example :

Reduced

In this reaction, hydrogen acting as a reducing
agent reduces Cu(II) oxide to copper. This is a
reduction reaction.

Cu? + 2e- > Cu (Reduction)

At the same time, hydrogen is oxidised to water
by the oxidising agent Cu(II) oxide, and this is an
oxidation reaction.

2H — 2e°- > 2H* (Oxidation)
Thus, the net reaction is a redox reaction.

It can be inferred from the above example
that an oxidising agent is an acceptor of
electron(s) and a reducing agent is a donor of
electron(s).

4.15 COVALENT (MOLECULAR) BOND

The chemical bond that is formed between two
combining atoms by mutual sharing of one or more
pairs of electrons is called a covalent (or a
molecular) bond and the compound formed due to
this bond is called a covalent compound.

The molecule formed due to the sharing of
electrons (covalent bond) is called a covalent
molecule.

The atoms of non-metals usually have 5, 6 or 7
electrons in their outermost shell (except carbon which
has 4 and hydrogen which has just 1 electron in the
outermost shell). The atoms of such elements do not
favour the loss of its electrons due to energy
considerations and thus the transfer of electrons is
not possible. Therefore, these atoms can complete their
octet only by mutually sharing one or more pairs of
electrons. Each atom contributes equal number of
electron(s). So, whenever a non-metal combines with
another non-metal (to attain stable configuration), the

sharing of electrons takes place between their atoms
and a covalent bond is formed.

For example, hydrogen is a non-metal and
chlorine is also a non-metal. When hydrogen combines
with chlorine to form hydrogen chloride (HCI), the
sharing of electrons takes place between hydrogen and
chlorine atoms and a covalent bond is formed. It should
be noted that a covalent bond can also be formed
between two atoms of the same non-metal. For
example, two chlorine atoms combine together by the
sharing of an electron each to form a chlorine molecule
(Cl,) and a covalent bond is formed between the two
chlorine atoms.

Covalent bonds are of three types :
1. Single covalent bond
2. Double covalent bond
3. Triple covalent bond

A single covalent bond is formed by the sharing
of one pair of electrons between the atoms, each atom
contributing one electron.


--- Page 20 ---
A single covalent bond is denoted by’ putting a’

short line (—) between the two atoms. So, a hydrogen
molecule can also be written as H—H.

Likewise, molecules of chlorine, hydrogen
chloride, water, ammonia, methane and carbon
tetrachloride are examples of single covalent bonds.

cl—Cl H—Cl H—O—H
Chlorine Hydrogen chloride Water
H Cl

H—N—H H—C—H Ccl—C—Cl
t | |
H H Cl
Ammonia Methane Carbon tetrachloride

Similarly, a double bond is formed by the sharing
of two pairs of electrons between two atoms.

A double bond is actually a combination of two
single bonds, so it is represented by putting two short
lines (=) between the two atoms. For example, oxygen
molecule, Oz, contains a double bond between two
atoms and it can be written as O=O.

A triple bond is a combination of three
single bonds, so it is represented by putting three
short lines (=) between the two atoms. Nitrogen
molecule, N>, contains a triple bond, so it is written
as N=N.

Some molecules have a combination of single
bond as well as a double or a triple bond. For example,
ethene (CH) molecule has one double covalent bond
and four single covalent bonds.

Ethene (C,H,)

Similarly, ethyne (C,H) molecule has one triple
covalent bond and two single covalent bonds.

The covalency of an atom is the number of its

electrons taking part in the formation of shared pairs.
Thus, the covalency of hydrogen is 1, oxygen 2,
nitrogen 3 and carbon 4.

Non-polar and polar covalent compounds

Covalent compounds are non polar when shared
pair of electron(s) are equally distributed between the
two atoms. No charge separation takes place. The
molecule is symmetrical and electrically neutral.

If the two covalently bonded atoms are identical
the shared electron pair(s) is at equal distance from the
combining atoms i.e., the shared electron pair(s) is
equally attracted by the nuclei of the two types of
charge, such molecules are non-polar. For example
hydrogen (H,), chlorine (Cl,), oxygen (O>), etc., are
perfectly non-polar compounds.

The covalent compounds are said to be polar
when the shared pair of electrons are not at equal
distance between the two atoms. This results in the
development of fractional positive and negative
charges on them. They ionise in water. For example,
hydrogen chloride.

Covalent bond is formed when both atoms have
four or more electrons in their outermost shells,

i.e., non-metals (exceptions are H, Be, B, Al, etc.).

Hydrogen can combine with all non-metals of
Group IVA to VIIA with the help of covalent bonds.

Note : As we move across a period, the electrovalent
character of chlorides, oxides, etc., decreases. An
example of the decreasing electrovalent character of
chlorides and oxides of the elements of 3rd period is

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE

The idea of the smallest unit of matter i.e. PARMANU which combines to give ANU was given by the
Indian scientist Maharshi Kanada.

Greek philosopher Democritus called the paramanu an ‘ATOM’.
John Dalton gave the first systematic idea of structure of atom.

Gases conduct electricity at very low pressure 0-01 mm of mercury and high potential at 10,000 volts
emitting rays known as cathode rays. These rays consist of negatively charged particles called
electrons.

Electrons are present in every atom. Its mass is | the mass of hydrogen atom. Its charge is 1-602 x 10-!9
1837

coulombs.

Goldstein showed the presence of positively charged particles, the nature of which depends upon the gas
used in the discharge tube. These positively charged subatomic particles are protons.

Chadwick discovered neutron in 1932. Neutron is an electrically neutral subatomic particle with mass equal
to that of a proton.

Rutherford showed the presence of a small heavy, positively charged centre — nucleus.

Electrons, protons and neutrons are the fundamental particles or subatomic particles. Protons and neutrons
are present in the central part of the atom i.e. in nucleus and collectively known as nucleons. Electrons are
outside the nucleus in orbits.

Atomic number (Z) of an element is equal to the number of protons and mass number (A) of an atom is
equal to the sum of the number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.

Electrons revolve around the nucleus in definite circular paths which are known as orbits or energy shells
and are numbered as 1, 2, 3, 4, ... ie. K, L, M and N, ...

Electronic configuration refers to the distribution of electrons in different shells.

Maximum number of electrons that can be filled in these shells is given by 2n? rule, where n denotes the
number of shells. However, the outermost orbit cannot have more than 8 electrons.

The outermost shell of an atom is called its valence shell and the electrons present in the valence shell are
known as valence electrons.

The chemical properties of elements are decided by these valence electrons, since they are the ones that
take part in chemical reactions.

Isotopes are the atoms of the same element possessing different mass numbers but the same atomic number.
Atoms of different elements that have the same mass number but different atomic number are called isobars.

During chemical reactions, atoms of all the elements become stable by acquiring electronic configuration of
the nearest inert gas, i.e. eight electrons in the outermost orbit, this is known as octet rule.

Bonds formed between metals and non-metals are ionic or electrovalent bonds.

The chemical bond that is formed between two combining atoms by mutual sharing of one or more pairs of

electrons is called a covalent (or a molecular) bond and the compound formed due to this bond is called a
covalent compound.
