— FLAME

Compounds of certain metals impart a characteristic colour
to a flame. The procedure to detect the colour imparted is as
follows.

A thin platinum wire is first thoroughly cleaned by dipping
it in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It is then heated in the non-
luminous flame of the burner. The process is repeated. When the
wire imparts no colour to the flame, it is ready for use.

PLATINUM

Now, the wire is first dipped in concentrated hydrochloric
acid and then into a small amount of the BURNER @}

(ii) Permanent hard water is softened by using
washing soda since permanent hardness is due to the
presence of sulphate and chlorides of calcium and
magnesium.

Soap and detergents

Soap : It is the sodium or potassium salt of an
organic fatty acid. It reacts with hard water forming
scum, which is why ordinary soap is wasted.

CaSO, + 2NaSt (soap) —> CaSt, + Na,SO,

sodium sterate Scum
Detergents : They are the sodium salts of alkyl
sulphonic acids. Detergents contain a sulphonic acid
group (SO3H) instead of a carboxylic group (- COOH).
They can lather even with hard water, since due
to the solubility of their calcium and magnesium salts
in water they do not form scum.

Comparing the effects of soaps and detergents on
hard water

Experiment IV : Take two beakers containing
samples of hard water. In one beaker, ordinary
soap is rubbed into the water, while in the other
beaker, a detergent is rubbed into the water.

Observation : Lather is formed in the. beaker
in which detergent is used, but lather does not form
when ordinary soap is rubbed.

Conclusion : Detergents form lather even with
hard water, while ordinary soap is wasted due to
formation of scum.

VI. WATER POLLUTION

Water pollution is the introduction of
substances of such character and in such quantity
that alter the natural quality of water and impair
its usefulness.

It affects the health of living organisms and may
offend the sense of sight, taste or smell. It refers to

Fig. 9.2 Sources of water pollution

any type of aquatic contamination which renders the
water unusable for living organisms.
Polluted water can be identified by the following:
(i) Foul smell from water
(ii) Bad taste of drinking water
(iii) Oil and grease floating on the surface of water
(iv) Excessive growth of algae and weeds in water.
All over the world, freshwater resources are
threatened not only by over-exploitation and poor
management but also by ecological degradation.
The main reasons for fresh water pollution are:
¢ Discharge of untreated waste
¢« Dumping of industrial effluents
¢ Run-off from agricultural fields
* Industrial growth, urbanization
* Increasing use of synthetic organic substances.


--- Page 14 ---
It is generally accepted that developed countries
suffer from problems of chemical discharge into
water sources and developing countries face problems
of agricultural run-off into water sources. Polluted
water causes water-borne diseases and leads to other
health-related problems.

SOURCES OF WATER POLLUTION

The main sources of water pollution are :

(i) Household detergents that are used for
washing purposes.
(ii) Sewage and domestic wastes.

(iii) Industrial wastes contain heavy metals,
their salts and organic compounds. All these
get accumulated in marine food chains.

(iv) Oil spills poison sea life.

(v) Thermal pollution raises the temperature
of water and depletes the oxygen present in
it, killing fishes and other aquatic organisms.

WATER QUALITY
Determination of water quality may be done in
two ways :
1. Select a water body and survey its specific
parameters throughout the year.

2. Select a specific parameter from the list given
below and measure it in different types of water
bodies.

These parameters and their effects on water
bodies are described below.
pH VALUE

The acidic and basic strengths of solutions are
measured on the hydrogen ion scale or pH scale,
which gives them a value called pH value.

Concentration of H+ ions present in solution
decides whether it is acidic or alkaline or neutral.

PH value is obtained with the help of a universal
indicator that changes colour at different pH values,
as shown below.

PH can be studied with the help of a pH
meter. pH value can also be read by matching a
wet paper with a standard printed colour scale.

¢ a solution of pH 7 is neutral (water)
* a solution of pH less than 7 is acidic

* a solution of pH more than 7 is basic

¢ the higher the pH above 7, the stronger the
base, and the lower the pH below 7, the
stronger the acid.

--- Page 15 ---
Pollution can change the pH of water, which
in turn can harm animals and plants living in it. For
instance, water coming out of an abandoned coal
mine can have a pH value as low as 2, which means
it is very acidic and would thus affect any creature
surviving in or on it.

Non-polluted water is one that has pH value 7
or close to 7. Thus, if the pH value of water is much
higher or lower than 7, that water is polluted and
potentially harmful.

Bacteria

Biological water quality assessment can also be
done by measuring growth of bacteria in a water
body.

Growth of bacteria can be measured by taking
a sample of water in a petri dish and observing it
under a microscope 3 or 4 times at regular intervals.

Water free of bacteria is non-polluted water,
whereas water with bacterial growth is considered
polluted.

Hardness

When water produces little or no lather with
soap, it is considered hard water. Hard water is
unsuitable for washing clothes, geysers as well as
for drinking. Hard water is regarded as polluted
water.

Dissolved oxygen

Dissolved oxygen is responsible for survival of
aquatic life in water. Dissolved oxygen is breathed
by fish and other aquatic life.

Moving water, such as we see in mountain
streams and large rivers, tends to contain a lot of

dissolved oxygen, but stagnant water contains little
of it.

If quantity of oxygen dissolved in stream or
river water is less than quantity of dissolved oxygen
in normal water, it is said to be polluted.

Quantity of dissolved oxygen can be measured
with the help of an instrument called Oxygen Flow
Meter.

Fig. 9.6 Instrument for measuring dissolved oxygen

Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)

Biological oxygen demand is a measure of the
oxygen utilized by micro-organisms during oxidation
of organic substances. Micro-organisms present in
a polluted water sample use oxygen to oxidize
waste, and thus BOD increases in polluted water.
Amount of oxygen present in pure water is
measured first, and then in polluted water. Decrease
in the amount of oxygen is the BOD value.
Biological oxygen demand increases in polluted
water.

Turbidity

Turbidity is the amount of particulate matter
suspended in water.

Turbidity measures the scattering effect that
suspended solids have on light; the higher the
intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity.
Materials that are responsible for turbidity include:

e clay
e waste matter containing insoluble substances
® microscopic organisms

As turbidity of water increases, its ability to
support aquatic life decreases.

WAY TO CONTROL WATER POLLUTION:  — © Heavier floating solids can be removed by

its into water bodies. * Organic matter should be removed by oxidation
or precipitation.

¢ Chemicals released from factories should be
treated to neutralize their toxic contents. ¢ Pathogens can be destroyed by ultraviolet
radiation.

OBJECT :
_ To find out the sources of pollution of water bodies in one’s locality and determine the quality of
water.
Procedure : In this project, survey of a locality is done where a DRAIN exists. The following datas
are collected.
The major sources of water pollution were found and they are :
(i) Household wastes. (ii) Detergents from clothes people wash.
(iii) Wastes from shops. (iv) Animals excreta accumulated by the sweeper.
(v) Wastes generated by a restaurant near (vi) Washes of nearby hospital.
the drain, including plastic packaging,
bottles, cans, food stuff and clothing.
(vii) Wastes from factories.
In order to determine the quality of water,
* 100 cm? of water is taken in a beaker for finding its pH value
* 500 cm? of water is taken in another beaker for measuring the oxygen dissolved in it.
Data obtained is as follows :

Conclusion :
1. If pH of water is less than 7, i.e. water is acidic, it would affect all living creatures present there. Acidity
results mainly from discharge of industrial effluents.
2. When Dissolved Oxygen (DO) decreases in a water body, mainly due to the carbon-containing matter
present in it, it becomes difficult for aquatic organisms that take dissolved oxygen to survive.

Thus, water quality is considered to be good when there is more dissolved oxygen, and it is considered
bad when there is less dissolved oxygen.
