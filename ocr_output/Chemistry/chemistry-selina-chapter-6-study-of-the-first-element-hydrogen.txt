POSITION OF HYDROGEN IN PERIODIC
TABLE

Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table.
Its atomic number is 1, and it has only one electron in
its valence shell. Therefore, it belongs to the first
group and the first period of the periodic table.

It is expected that the properties of hydrogen
should be similar to those of the other members of the
Ist group, but this is not the case. Ever since Mendeleev
presented his periodic table, the position of hydrogen
in the table has been a matter of controversy and
debate. This is mainly because some of the properties

of hydrogen resemble the properties of the Group IA
elements (alkali metals) while others are similar to
those of the Group VII A (halogens) elements.
Thompson suggested a separate position for hydrogen.
He puts it at the top of the periodic table; that does
not disturb the symmetry of the modern periodic table.

Action of air : Alkali metals are so reactive that
they get rapidly tarnished when exposed to air. This
is due to the formation of oxides and hydroxides,
and finally, carbonates, on their surface.

Note ; Hydrogen shows a dual nature since it resembles

the alkali metals of Group IA and the halogens of
Group VII A (17).

6.2 SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HYDROGEN AND

ALKALI METALS Example :
1. Electronic configuration: They have only one 4Na + O, > 2Na,O

. Valence electrons : All elements have one electron
in their outermost orbit, i.e. their valency shell
and so all of them have one valence electron.

. Valency : All alkali metals, including hydrogen,
have valency 1.

. Ion formation : Each of them can form cation, i.e.
positive ion, by loss of an electron.

compounds.

Hydrogen — forms HO; H,S; HCl
Sodium — forms Na,O; Na,S; NaCl
and so on.

SIMILARITIES BETWEEN HYDROGEN AND
HALOGENS

. 1. Electronic configuration : Hydrogen and
H>H* +e halogens have one electron less than the nearest
Na > Nat+e H = | (He = 2],

As such all these elements have electropositive
character.

. Reducing power : Both the alkali metals
and hydrogen act as reducing agents.

CuO + H, — Cu+H,0
CuO + 2Na — Cu + Na,O
. Burning : Hydrogen burns in oxygen to form its
oxide (water).
2H, + O, > 2H,O
Hydrogen burns with a pop sound.
Alkali metals also burn vigorously when heated
in oxygen to form their respective oxides.
Lithium forms monoxide

F = 2, 7 [Ne = 2, 8),
Ci = 2, 8, 7 (Ar 2, 8, 8)

. Valency : Both have valency 1.

Thus, they accept one electron to attain the
electronic configuration of the nearest inert gas.

. Formation of ions : Both show a tendency to form

anions since they are one electron short of the
nearest inert gas configuration.

. Electronegative character : Both halogens

and hydrogen are non-metals. They show
electronegative character.

while potassium, rubidium and caesium form
superoxides having the general formula MO,
(where M stands for metal).

chlorine), hydrogen too is a gas.

Atomicity : Hydrogen as well as halogens exist
in the form of diatomic molecules (H,, F,, CL,
Br,, I).


--- Page 3 ---
Properties of Hydrogen different from those of
Alkali Metals and Halogens.

1. Hydrogen atom has only one shell but alkali
metals and halogens have two or more shells.

2. Oxide of hydrogen, H,0, is a neutral oxide.
Oxides of halogens like CLO, C1,0,, etc., are
acidic in nature, while oxides of alkali metals like
Na,O, K,O, etc. are basic in nature.

6.4 DISCOVERY

The credit for the discovery of hydrogen goes
to Henry Cavendish (1766), although Robert
Boyle had prepared the gas in 1672. Not only did
Cavendish prepare the gas from iron and dilute
acids, he also established its elementary nature and
showed that water is formed when this gas burns
in air, He called it inflammable air because of its
combustible nature. It was on account of its ability
to form water that Lavoisier, in 1783, named it
hydrogen (Greek word meaning water former).

6.5 OCCURRENCE
Free state

In free state, hydrogen is found in traces in the
earth’s crust and atmosphere. Volcanic gases contain
0:025% of it, the earth’s crust 0-98%, the earth’s
atmosphere 0-01% and the atmospheres of the Sun and
the stars contain 1.1% hydrogen.

Combined state

(i) Plant and animal tissues are made up of
compounds of hydrogen with carbon, oxygen and
nitrogen.

(ii) Hydrogen is the characteristic constituent of
acids, alkalis, hydrocarbons and proteins. In
addition to these, sugar, starch, petroleum
products, proteins, carbohydrates and also fats
contain hydrogen.

(iii) In water, it is 11-1% by weight.

6.6 PREPARATION OF HYDROGEN
Since water, acids and alkalis contain hydrogen,

they form the cheapest raw materials for preparation

and manufacture of hydrogen.

6.6.1 Hydrogen from water

Hydrogen from cold water and metals

Reactive metals like potassium, sodium and
calcium react with cold water forming their
corresponding hydroxides and evolving hydrogen.
Their reactions are exothermic.

(a) Potassium :

1. Potassium when added to water, floats on
water (density 0-86 g/cc).

2. It melts [at 62°C], forming a silver grey globule
that darts about on the surface of the water.

3. Reaction : 2K + 2H,O —> 2KOH + H,
The reaction is highly exothermic and vigorous.

4. It catches fire and burns with a lilac-coloured
flame.

5. Bubbles of hydrogen gas are seen, and the solution
formed is colourless, soapy and alkaline.

POTASSIUM

COLD WATER

Fig. 6.1 Action of potassium on cold water

Although pure hydrogen burns with a pale blue
flame, the colour of the flame is lilac due to the
presence of traces of potassium vapour.

Caution! Potassium readily catches fire in air
because it reacts with water vapour. So it is kept in
kerosene oil and handled carefully. Do not touch it
with your hand, rather use a pair of tongs.

(b) Sodium :

1. It floats on water; density 0.97 g/cc; melting point
97°C.

2. It melts, forming a silvery globule, which darts
about on the surface of the water.

3. Reaction : 2Na + 2H,O —> 2NaOH + H,

The reaction is less exothermic and less vigorous
as compared to potassium.

HYDROGEN

Fig. 6.2 Action of sodium on water

4. It catches fire and burns with a golden yellow

flame.

5. Bubbles of hydrogen gas are produced, and the
solution formed is colourless, soapy, slightly warm
and alkaline.

Note : Sodium amalgam (alloy of sodium with
mercury) and potassium amalgam react smoothly with
water. Therefore hydrogen can be safely prepared
from these amalgams.

(c) Calcium :
1. Calcium sinks in water.
2. Reaction : Ca + 2H,O ——> Ca(OH), + H,
Reaction is less vigorous than sodium.

3. Bubbles of hydrogen are liberated, and the
solution turns milky, turbid and alkaline. If red
litmus is introduced in solution it turns blue.

Action of hot water and steam on metals

(i) Magnesium reacts slowly with boiling water
and forms a base, magnesium hydroxide
liberating hydrogen gas.

Mg + 2H,O > Mg(OH), + H,T

(ii) Magnesium burns in steam with an intense
white light, liberating hydrogen gas and white
ash, i.e., magnesium oxide.

Mg + H,O > MgO + H,T
Magnesium oxide crumbles down due to
heating, further exposing magnesium to steam
results in the liberation of hydrogen gas.

Action of steam on metals
(a) Aluminium :
1. It reacts with steam to liberate hydrogen.

2. It forms aluminium oxide, which makes it
inactive, and liberates hydrogen. There is no
further reaction due to the oxide coating.

2Al + 3H,0 22, aL, + 3H,

Steam
3. At high temperature, however, the coating breaks
and aluminium reacts with steam, liberating
hydrogen.
(b) Zinc:
1. It is even less reactive i.e. it reacts only when it is
heated and steam is passed over it.

2. Hydrogen is liberated and zinc is converted to
white zinc oxide.

Zn + H,O > ZnO + H,

3. Zinc oxide is yellow when it is hot but white when
it is cold.

(c) Iron:

1. Iron is less reactive than zinc, but red hot iron
reacts with steam, forming triferric tetra-oxide
and hydrogen gas.

2. This reaction is reversible. If the hydrogen
formed is not removed, the iron oxide formed
is reduced back to iron.

Fig. 6.5 Action of iron on steam

Note : In the beginning, the forward reaction
is fast and the backward reaction is slow, since the
speed of a reaction is directly related to the masses
(or the concentrations) of the reacting substances.
As the reactants get consumed, the forward reaction
becomes slower. In other words, as the products
are formed, the backward reaction becomes faster.
There comes a time when the forward and
backward reactions acquire the same speed.
Thereafter, the reaction does not appear to move
in a single direction, and the amounts of the
reactants and the products do not change. This
equilibrium stage is attained at 700°C.

An equilibrium, that is attained through a chemical

change is known as a chemical equilibrium.

Note : When metals react with steam :

(i) rate of reaction is fastest in the case of
magnesium but it progressively decreases in
the cases of aluminium, zinc and iron.

(ii) in the case of magnesium, aluminium and

zinc, the reactions stop after some time.
This is because the oxides of these metals
stick to the surfaces of the respective metals
and thus do not allow steam to come into
contact with the metal.

Action of steam on non-metals

Carbon : When steam is passed over red hot coke,
water gas (CO + H,) is formed.

6.7. APPLICATION OF ACTIVITY SERIES IN THE
PREPARATION OF HYDROGEN

Based on reaction with water, metals are arranged
in decreasing order of reactivity.

K

Na Arrangement of metals in decreasing
Me order of reactivity in the form of a
Al series is called the activity or reactivity
Zn series of metals.

Fe

Pb

nm Thus, potassium being the most reactive
Hg metal is placed at the top of the list, and
Ag the least reactive metal being gold, is
Au placed at the bottom of the list.

Hydrogen, though it is a non-metal, is
included in this series because it can form a
positive ion. It would occupy a position based on
formation of its positive ion.

The ability of metals to reduce water to hydrogen
decreases on going down the series.

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn.......0......

Lead and the metals that are further below in the
activity series : No reaction with water, even when the
metal is hot and steam is used.

6.7.1 Salient features of the Activity Series
(i) Electropositive character decreases down the
series.
(ii) Reducing power of metals decreases down the

series. Thus, potassium is the strongest reducing
agent.

_ (iti) Tendency of metals to lose valence electrons, i.e.
tendency of metals to get oxidized, decreases
down the series. Thus, potassium is the most
readily oxidized metal.

(iv) Metals above hydrogen displace hydrogen from
water and dilute acid, but metals below hydrogen
do not.

2Na + 2H,O — 2NaOH + H,
Cu + H,O — No reaction
Zn + 2HCI (dil.) — ZnCl, + H,
Cu + HCI (dil.) — No reaction

(v) A metal higher up in the series displaces a metal
below it from the salt solutions of the latter.

CuSO,(aq) + Zn — ZnSO,(aq) + Cu
Larger the difference in the positions of the

91


--- Page 6 ---
metals in the activity series, more rapidly the
displacement occurs.
(vi) Oxides of metals K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al cannot
be reduced by common reducing agents like H,,
CO or C. They can be reduced only by electrolysis.
Metal oxides below aluminium can be reduced by
heating them in the presence of reducing agents.
ZnO + C > Zn + CO
PbO + C > Pb + CO

@¢ When dilute sulphuric acid or dilute
hydrochloric acid reacts with metals above
hydrogen in the activity series, hydrogen is
produced. But in the case of metals below
hydrogen in the activity series, like copper.
silver, etc., this does not happen.

¢ Magnesium, aluminium, zinc and iron react
with dilute HCI or dilute H,SO,, liberating

PbO + CO > Pb + CO,
PbO + H, > Pb + H,O

(vii) Oxides and nitrates of less reactive metals like
Hg, Ag and Au decompose on strong heating to
give metals.

2HgO — 2Hg + O,
2AgNO, — 2Ag + 2NO, + O,
(viii) Metals below copper do not rust easily.

(ix) Since the reactivity series lists metals in
decreasing order of electropositivity, it is
expected that those at the top will combine with
more electronegative elements in their minerals.
For example, sodium and potassium occur
mainly as their chlorides, aluminium as its oxide,
and zinc, lead, copper, mercury and silver as
their sulphides.

6.7.2 Displacement of hydrogen from dilute acids

Hydrogen is displaced from dilute hydrochloric
acid and dilute sulphuric acid when the latter react with
some metals which are more reactive than hydrogen.

The extent to which these reactions occur for a given
metal is also based on the activity series of metals.

These displace hydrogen from dilute acids (HCI or
H,SO,) with explosive violence

These displace hydrogen from dilute acids (HCI or

H,SO,) vigorously, but not violently forming
their respective salts

‘ These displace hydrogen from dilute acids (HC! or

H,SO,) gently forming their respective salts

These do not displace hydrogen from dilute acids
at all

hydrogen and forming their respective salts.

2. Aluminium

2Al + 3H,SO, — AL(SO,), + 3H,
3. Zinc

Zn + H,SO, — ZnSO, + 4H,
4. Iron

Fe + 2HCI — FeCl, + H,

Zinc is the most preferred metal in laboratory
preparation of hydrogen because of the following
reasons :

(i) Sodium and potassium react violently with
acid.

(ii) Calcium and magnesium are expensive.

(iii) Aluminium forms a protective coating of
Al,O, due to its great affinity for oxygen.
So, it does not give hydrogen with acid after
the reaction has occured for some time.

(iv) Iron has to be heated, but then the
hydrogen thus produced contains impurities

like hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide.

(v) Lead reacts with dilute sulphuric or
hydrochloric acid and forms an insoluble
coating of lead sulphate or lead chloride.
Therefore, further reaction is prevented.

(vi) Hydrogen cannot be prepared from metals
that are below it in the activity series of
metals, such as copper and mercury, since
only metals that are more reactive than
hydrogen can displace it from acids.

e.g., Cu + HCl — No reaction
(dil.)

6.7.3 Displacement of hydrogen by alkalis

Metals like zinc, lead and aluminium have a
unique nature. They react with acids and can even
react with hot concentrated alkalis to form hydrogen
and a soluble salt.

Zinc granules are preferred for this reaction over pure
zinc because the impurity present in granulated zinc is

copper, whose catalysing effect speeds up the rate
of reaction.

Observation :

Reaction will gradually start in the form of
effervescence and evolution of gas. When all the air
from the apparatus has been expelled, collect the gas.

Collection of hydrogen

Hydrogen is collected by the downward
displacement of water because :

100

(i) it is virtually insoluble in water (20 mL of
hydrogen disolves in 1litre of water under normal
conditions).

(ii) it forms an explosive mixture with air and
therefore cannot be collected by downward
displacement of air even though it is lighter
than it.

Impurities present with hydrogen :

(i) hydrogen sulphide (H,S)

(ii) sulphur dioxide (SO,)

(iii) oxides of nitrogen

(iv) phosphine (PH,)

(v) arsine (AsH,)

(vi) .carbon dioxide

(vii) water vapour

Impurities can be removed from hydrogen by

passing it through

1. Silver nitrate solution [to remove arsine and
phosphine].

4. A drying agent used to dry the gas. Common
drying agents like fused calcium chloride, caustic
potash stick and phosphorous pentoxide remove
water vapour.

Thus the gas is purified and dried, and then
collected over mercury, because mercury has no
reaction with it.

Concentrated sulphuric acid is a good drying agent
but it is not used to dry hydrogen as it reacts with
hydrogen, thus defeating the purpose of the
reaction.

H,SO, + H, > 2H,0 + SO,

Precautions :

The following precautions must be taken while
preparing the gas because a mixture of hydrogen
and air explodes violently when it is brought near a
flame.

1. The apparatus should be airtight and there should
be no leakage of gas.

2. There should be no flame burning near the
apparatus.

3. The gas should be collected only after
all the air in the apparatus has escaped. This
can be ascertained by collecting some amount of
gas in a test tube and taking it to a flame. If
the gas burns quietly, then there is no more air in
the flask.

4. The end of the thistle funnel should be dipped
under acid so as to prevent gas from escaping
from the thistle funnel.

Note:

1. Nitric acid, even in its dilute form, is not used in
preparation of hydrogen from metals because:

Nitric acid is a powerful oxidizing agent, and the
oxygen formed due to its decomposition oxidizes
the hydrogen to give water, thus defeating the
purpose of the reaction.

3Zn + 8HNO, — 3Zn(NO,), + 4H,0 + 2NOT
2. Magnesium [Mg] and manganese [Mn] are the only

metals that react with very dilute nitric acid (1%
nitric acid) to liberate hydrogen. The oxidizing

w

action of the acid is much reduced due to its over-
dilution.
Mg + 2HNO, -> Mg(NO,), + H,T
3. Concentratcd sulphuric acid is not used in
preparation of hydrogen as it will produce sulphur
dioxide.

Zn + 2H,SO, — ZnSO, + SO, + 2H,O

TEST FOR HYDROGEN

1. Hydrogen is combustible but it does not support
combustion.

2. It burns silently in air or oxygen with a pale blue
flame, forming water.

2H, + O, > 2H,O

When it is premixed with air or oxygen, it
explodes with a pop sound.

6.9 MANUFACTURE OF HYDROGEN
I. Bosch process :

It consists of the following steps :
(i) Steam is passed over hot coke (1000°C) in
furnaces of a special design, called converters,
giving water gas.

c + Ho “SS Co+H)- A

hot coke steam water gas
The reaction is endothermic.
(41) Water gas is mixed with excess steam and passed
over heated ferric oxide, which acts as a catalyst,
and chromic oxide Cr,O,, which acts as a promoter.

Fe,0,
(CO + H,) + HO ——— CO, + 2H, +A
water gas steam orc
The reaction is exothermic.
(iii) Separation of carbon dioxide
The above mixture, i.e. CO, + H,, is forced
through cold water under pressure (30 atm), or
through caustic potash solution, which dissolves
the more soluble carbon dioxide, leaving hydrogen.
2KOH + CO, > K,CO, + H,O
(iv) Separation of carbon monoxide
The mixture is passed through ammoniacal
cuprous chloride solution in order to dissolve any
uncombined carbon monoxide.
CuCl + CO + 2H,0 — CuCl. CO. 2H,O0
Thus, hydrogen gas is left behind.

Il. By electrolysis of water :

Commercially hydrogen is also obtained by
electrolysis of acidulated water.

Water is a poor conductor of electricity. In order

to make it a conductor, a very small amount of less
volatile acid, sulphuric acid (H,SO,), is added.

At cathode H* +e" — H

Oxygen is evolved at the anode.

Thus, water dissociates to give hydrogen and

The main advantage of this process lies in the
fact that oxygen is simultaneously produced at the

6.10 PROPERTIES OF HYDROGEN
6.10.1 Physical properties

1. Colour : Colourless.
2. Odour : Odourless.
3. Taste : Tasteless.
4. Physiological
nature : Non-toxic.
5. Density : 0-0899 g/mL. It is the lightest known

gas. It is 14-4 times less dense than
air.

6. Solubility : Very slightly soluble in water.

[1 L of water dissolves about 20 mL
of the gas under normal conditions].

: Liquefies at below -240°C under
pressure of about 20 atmosphere.

7. Liquefaction

Occlusion : Hydrogen is readily adsorbed by
palladium or platinum or nickel at room temperature.
For example, one volume of finely divided palladium
takes up 900 volumes of hydrogen at room temperature.
This phenomenon is called occlusion or adsorption.

1. Reaction of hydrogen with non-metals

To prove that hydrogen is a very light gas -

Experiment : Take soap solution in a ‘Betker
and allow hydrogen to pass through it. To

On passing hydrogen gas through the soap
solution, soap bubbles filled with hydrogen fly higher
and burst out. This behaviour proves that hydrogen
is lighter than air.

6.10.2 Chemical properties

Hydrogen is a reactive element; it reacts with
non-metals, metals, metallic oxides and even organic
compounds under appropriate conditions. It does not
support combustion.

Condition and observations

Hydrogen burns (in presence of electric spark) with a ‘pop’ sound in oxygen, and
with a pale blue flame, forming water. Pure hydrogen bums quietly in air (Fig. 6.10).

Equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine react slowly in diffused sunlight
but explosively in direct sunlight.
This is because a spontaneous reaction takes place, with release of a large amount

of energy. However, hydrogen continues to burn in chlorine.

Water

Three volumes of hydrogen and one volume of nitrogen react at temperature of
(ammonia) 450-500°C, pressure 200-900 atm, in presence of catalyst finely divided iron
with molybdenum as promoter.

Hydrogen gas, when passed through molten sulphur, reacts to give another gas
(hydrogen sulphide).

Note : Hydrogen forms an explosive mixture with air
(due to the oxygen present in air). If the amount of
air is less in the mixture, the explosion is not
dangerous, i.e. the gas burns with a pop sound only.
But a large volume of mixture causes a dangerous
explosion leading to serious damage and injuries.
(Hydrogen-oxygen mixture is called detonating
mixture).

3. Reaction with metallic oxides
(i) Hydrogen gas is a strong reducing agent.
Hydrogen reduces the oxides of the less active
metals, i.e. it removes oxygen from strongly

heated metal oxides when passed over them and
itself gets oxidized to water.

between two carbon atoms. This process is
known as hydrogenation.

6.11 USES OF HYDROGEN
1. Asa fuel : Because of its high heat of combustion,
hydrogen is used as a fuel in the form of :
(i) Coal gas,
(ii) Water gas (CO + H,),
(iii) Liquid hydrogen (non-polluting and easy to
store).
2. Oxy-hydrogen torch : A mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen is burnt in a specially-designed

apparatus called an oxy-hydrogen torch to
produce temperatures touching 2500°C. The
flame is used for cutting and welding metals, for
melting platinum and quartz, and for fusing
alumina to produce synthetic rubies and
sapphires that are used as jewels in watches.

. Atomic hydrogen torch : Creates high

temperature (2800°C), which is used for welding
alloys containing metals like tungsten,
manganese and chromium.

. Inself-lighting gas jets and automatic lighters.

For manufacture of ammonia (Haber Process),
hydrogen chloride, methyl alcohol :

CO+ 2H, » CH,OH
(Methyl alcohol)

For hydrogenation of vegetable oil : Hydrogen
is used in preparation of solid vanaspati ghee
from liquid vegetable fats like groundnut oil,
coconut oil, etc. This process is called catalytic
hydrogenation of oils because it takes place in
the presence of finely-divided nickel or platinum
or palladium acting as catalyst. This process
occurs at high pressure and at a temperature of
about 200°C.

For producing artificial petrol from coal
Passage of hydrogen under high pressure over
powdered coal in presence of a catalyst is known
as hydrogenation of coal. It produces a product
similar to petroleum but containing a higher
proportion of hydrogen.

. In extraction of metals : Hydrogen reduces

heated metallic oxide to metals (less active metal
oxides).

6.12 OXIDATION AND REDUCTION
6.12.1 Oxidation

In the electronic concept, oxidation is defined
as a process in which an atom or an ion loses
electron(s).

Zn — Zn2+ + 2e-

Oxidation is also defined as a chemical process
that involves :

(i) Addition of oxygen :

Element + oxygen -—> oxide

C+0, > CO,
2Mg +O, — 2 MgO

In the above reactions, by gaining oxygen carbon
and magnesium, are oxidised to carbon dioxide, and
magnesium oxide respectively.

(ii) Addition of electronegative ion :
2FeCl, + Clp — 2FeCl,
Zn+2HC] > ZnCl, + Hy
Ferrous chloride and zinc are oxidized to ferric
chloride and zinc chloride, respectively, by gain of
electronegative ion CI-.

(iii) Removal of hydrogen :
HS +Cl, + 2HCI+S
Hydrogen sulphide is oxidized to sulphur by loss
of hydrogen.

(iv) Removal of electropositive ion (element) :

2KI+H,0O, > 2KOH +I,
Potassium iodide is oxidized to iodine by loss
of electropositive ion K+.
Oxidizing agents

An oxidizing agent is one that oxidizes other
substances either by accepting electrons or by
providing oxygen or an electronegative ion, or by

removing hydrogen or an electropositive ion. Thus,
in the above examples (given in oxidation), oxygen,
chlorine, hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide
are oxidizing agents.

Some examples of oxidizing agents.

(i) Solids : Manganese dioxide, red lead, lead
dioxide, potassium permanganate (KMnQ,),
potassium dichromate (K,Cr,07), bleaching
powder, etc.

(ii) Liquids : Hydrogen peroxide, conc. nitric acid,
conc. sulphuric acid, bromine, etc.

(iii) Gaseous : Oxygen, ozone, chlorine, etc.

Tests for oxidizing agents
Most oxidizing agents respond to the following tests:

(i) On heating strongly, they liberate oxygen,
which rekindles a glowing splinter.

(ii) They may form a yellow precipitate of sulphur
when hydrogen sulphide is bubbled through
their solutions.

(iii) On warming with conc. hydrochloric acid, they
liberate chlorine, that bleaches moist litmus
paper.

(iv) On treating with acidified potassium iodide
solution, they liberate iodine, which imparts a
blue colour to a freshly-prepared starch solution
(an oxidizing agent also turns potassium iodide
paper brown due to liberation of iodine).

6.12.2 Reduction

In the electronic concept, reduction is defined
as a process in which an atom or an ion gains
electrons.

Cu2+ + 2e- > Cu


--- Page 15 ---
- Reduction is also defined as a chemical process
that involves :
(i) Removal of oxygen :
Oxide + element — metal
Cu0+H, — Cu+H,0
Zn0+C > Zn+CO
Copper (II) oxide and zinc (II) oxide are reduced
to copper and zinc respectively, by losing oxygen.
(ii) Addition of electropositive ion :
2HgCl, + SnClp > Hg Cl, + SnCl,

Mercuric chloride is reduced to mercurous chloride
by gain of electropositive ion Hg*.

(iii) Addition of hydrogen :
Cl, +H,S > 2HCl +S
2NH; + 3Cl > N+ 6HCI
Chlorine is reduced to hydrogen chloride by gain
of hydrogen.
(iv) Removal of electronegative ion :
2FeCl, + H,S > 2FeCl, + 2HCI+S

Ferric chloride is reduced to ferrous chloride by
loss of electronegative ion Cl-.

Reducing agents

A reducing agent is one that reduces other
substances either by providing electrons, or by
providing hydrogen or an electropositive ion, or by
removing oxygen or an electronegative ion. Thus, in
the above examples (given in reduction), hydrogen
sulphide, ammonia, stannous chloride, hydrogen and
carbon are reducing agents.
Some examples of reducing agents.

(i) Solids : Carbon, metals like Zn, Al, Cu and
Na, stannous chloride, glucose, etc.
(ii) Liquids: Hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen iodide,
hydrogen bromide, etc.
(iii) Gaseous: Hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide,
etc.
Tests for reducing agents
Reducing agents generally respond to the following
tests :

(i) They give out brown fumes of nitrogen dioxide,
when warmed with nitric acid.

(il) Lney cnange viack copper ul) oxide, on
heating, to a red copper metal.

(iii) They decolourise the pink colour of dilute
potassium permanganate solution.

(iv) They change the colour of acidified potassium
dichromate solution from orange to green.

(v) They change the light yellow colour of iron
(III) salts in solution to a light green colour
[due to the formation of iron (II) salts].

REDOX (OXIDATION-REDUCTION) REACTIONS

In a chemical reaction, if one substance is
oxidized, the other substance must necessarily be
reduced. This is because the electrons lost during
oxidation are simultaneously gained during reduction,
and vice versa.

For example : When zinc reacts with copper
sulphate solution to form zinc sulphate and copper:
CuSO, + Zn — ZnSO, + Cu
Cu*SO?' + Zn > Zn**SOF + Cu
Writing half reaction
Zn — Zn+ + 2e7 (oxidation)
Cu2+ + 2e~ — Cu (reduction)
They occur simultaneously as

Cu2+ + Zn — Zn2+ +Cu
| L oxidation
Reduction
Thus, oxidation and reduction always go side
by side.

A reaction in which oxidation and reduction take place
simultaneously is known as REDOX REACTION. .

Examples of redox reactions

(1) Oxidized
rT t~C~:::COY
CuO + #£#H, > Cu+H,0

Oxidizing agent Reducing agent

Reduced

In this reaction, hydrogen, the reducing agent,
reduces the oxidizing agent Cu (II) oxide to copper.
On the other hand, oxidation reaction is the
oxidation of the reducing agent, hydrogen, to water,
by the oxidizing agent, Cu (II) oxide. Thus the net
reaction is a redox reaction.

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE

Hydrogen is placed in the Ist period and IA group of the periodic table. It shows dual nature as it

resembles the alkali metals of group IA and also the halogens of Group VU A (17).

Hydrogen is found in traces in the earth’s crust; thé sun and the stars contain 1-1% hydrogen. It is present in

plant and animal tissues, acids, alkalies, water and hydrocarbons.

Hydrogen is prepared from water by reacting active metals like potassium, sodium and calcium with cold

water, magnesium with boiling water and zinc and red hot iron with steam.

Dilute sulphuric acid and dilute hydrochloric acid displace hydrogen when they react with any metal above

hydrogen in the activity series.

Zinc, lead, aluminium are unique metals. They produce hydrogen by reacting with acids as well as

alkalies.

Hydrogen is prepared in the lab by reacting granulated zinc with dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric

acid, and it is collected by the downward displacement of water. This hydrogen contains impurities that are

then removed.

Impurities like H,S are removed by passing hydrogen through lead nitrate solution, CO,, SO, and oxides of

nitrogen through KOH solution, PH, and AsH, through silver nitrate solution, and water vapour through a

drying agent like fused calcium chloride.

Magnesium and manganese are the only two metals that can react with very dilute nitric acid to

produce hydrogen.

On a large scale, hydrogen is obtained by

(i) electrolysis of water; acidulated water (water + sulphuric acid) is electrolysed to get hydrogen at
cathode and oxygen at anode.

(ii) passing steam over red hot coke (Bosch process).

Hydrogen is the lightest gas. It burns with a pop sound and is absorbed by metals like palladium.

It reacts with metals and non-metals under appropriate conditions.

It is a reducing agent and thus reduces metallic oxides to metals. For example, black copper oxide is
reduced to brown copper and yellow lead oxide is reduced to silvery grey lead.

Hydrogen is used as a fuel as well.
