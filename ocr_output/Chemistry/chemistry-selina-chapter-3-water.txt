3.1 INTRODUCTION

Water is the most important natural resource;
more than 70% of Earth’s area is occupied with water.
However, hardly 2°5% of this water makes up the
world’s supply of fresh water, including the frozen
water in polar ice caps and glaciers. ——

Water is a major constituent of all living things
(plants, animals and human beings) and of the
atmospheric environment in which we live. Nearly
70% of our body weight is water.

Water occurs in both free and combined states.

Ordinarily, water exists in the liquid state. When
heated under normal pressure (760 mm Hg), water
boils at 100°C and changes rapidly into its gaseous
state (steam). When steam condenses back into water,
heat is released. This heat is called latent heat of
condensation, and it is equal to latent heat of
vaporization.

It is the sudden release of latent heat of

condensation that causes the violence associated
with torrential rain. ,

3.2 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF WATER

1. Nature : Pure water is a clear, transparent
liquid. It is colourless, odourless and tasteless.

The taste in water is due to gases and solids
dissolved in it, i.e. impurities present in it.

2. Boiling point : Under normal pressure, pure
water boils at 100°C. The boiling point of water is
affected by pressure because boiling point of a liquid
is considered as the temperature when vapour
pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. Thus, the
greater the pressure, the higher the boiling point, and
vice versa. This is the principle by which a pressure
cooker works.

In the hills, water boils at temperature
lower than 100°C with atmospheric pressure being
low (70°C on the top of Mount Everest) and so food is
not cooked properly there. Therefore, pressure cookers
are useful in the hills.

The boiling point of water also increases due to the
presence of dissolved impurities in it.

3. Freezing point of water or melting point of
ice : Pure water freezes at 0°C under normal pressure
(one atmosphere). The freezing point of water
decreases with increase in pressure.

The freezing point of water also decreases due to the
presence of dissolved impurities in it.

4. Density : At 4°C, water has its maximum
density, 1 g/cm? or 1000 kg/m3, and minimum volume.
Water expands on freezing, i.e. 92 volumes of
water become 100 volumes of ice. Therefore, with
relative density of ice being 0-92, it floats.

5. Anomalous expansion of water : Water has
an unusual physical property. When cooled, it first
contracts in volume, as do other liquids, but below
4°C, it starts expanding and continues to do so till the
temperature reaches 0°C, the point at which it freezes
into ice.

DENSITY (g/mL)

TEMPERATURE °C ~—
Fig. 3.3 Water has maximum density at 4°C

The property of anomalous expansion of water
enables marine life to exist in the colder regions of
the world, because even when the water freezes on
the surface, it remains a liquid below the ice layer
(Fig. 3.4).

AIR BELOW 0°G

Fig. 3.4 Formation of ice at the top of a pond.

6. Latent heat of fusion of ice : The latent heat
of fusion is the amount of heat required to change a
substance from the solid state to its liquid state at its
melting point without any change in temperature.

The amount of heat energy required by ice to
change into water, is called latent heat of fusion of
ice. Its specific value is 336 J/g or 80 cal/g. The
same amount of heat is released when 1 g of water
solidifies to form 1 g of ice at 0°C.

It is on account of high specific latent heat of
solidification that lakes and rivers do not freeze
suddenly.


--- Page 3 ---
7. Latent heat of vaporization of Water > When "’

water is boiled, it changes to gaseous state.

The energy required to change water into its
vapour at its boiling point without any change in
temperature is called latent heat of vaporization of
water, and its specific value is 2268 J/g or 540 cal/g.
The same amount of heat is released when 1 g of
steam condenses to form 1 g of water at 100°C.

It is on account of high specific latent heat of
vaporization that steam causes far more serious burns
than water at 100°C.

8. Specific heat capacity : It has been found that
1 g of water, when heated through 1°C, always absorbs
4.2 J (or 1 calorie) of heat energy. The fixed amount
of heat absorbed by 1 g of water, when heated through
1°C, is called its specific heat capacity.

Water because of its high specific heat is
commonly used as coolant in motor car radiators,
desert coolers, etc.

Due to its high specific heat capacity, the presence of
a large amount of water is able to modify the climate
of the nearby land areas, making them warmer in
winter and cooler in summer. Land and sea breeze are
also set up because of this great. moderating property
of water.

3.3 WATER AS UNIVERSAL SOLVENT

Water is a remarkable solvent. It dissolves many
substances, forming aqueous solutions (water
solutions). Water has a high dielectric constant.
As a result, it reduces the electrostatic force of
attraction between positive and negative ions and
dissolves even inorganic compounds, which are
usually electrovalent. Not only solids, but also gases
and other liquids dissolve in water. Hence, it is
difficult to find absolutely pure water in nature. For
the same reason, water is also called universal
solvent.

Substances that are apparently insoluble in water
actually dissolve in it in traces. Even when we put
water in a glass vessel, an extremely small amount
of glass dissolves in it. It is for this reason that,

when distilled water is kept in a sealed bottle
for a long time, it leaves etchings on the inside

surface of glass.

Experiment :~f0° ShOW that ordinary tap water
contains dissolved solids.

Procedure : Put some tap water on a clean watch
glass, and place it over a beaker containing water, as
shown in Fig. 3.5. Boil the water in the beaker. When
all the water has evaporated from the watch glass,
remove it from the burner and let it cool.

GLASS AFTER EVAPORATION

Observation : On looking at the watch glass
against light, a number of concentric rings of solid
matter are seen. These are the dissolved solids left
behind after evaporation of water.

Importance of dissolved salts in water
The dissolved solids in water are salts, minerals
and impurities.
1. They are essential for growth and development
of plants.
2. They add taste to water.

3. They supply the essential minerals needed by our
bodies.

Note : Tap water, river water and well water contain
dissolved solids, but rainwater and distilled water do

not contain dissolved solids, and so concentric rings
are not formed in their case.

AIR DISSOLVED IN WATER

Air is present in dissolved state in all the natural
sources of water. Of the two main components of air
(nitrogen and oxygen), oxygen is more soluble in water
than nitrogen.

Note : Since oxgyen is more soluble in water
compared to nitrogen, the air dissolved in water

differs from ordinary air.



--- Page 4 ---
Experiment : To show that tap water contdins —

dissolved gases (air).

Procedure : Fill around-bottom flask completely
with tap water, and arrange the apparatus as shown in
Fig. 3.6.

A graduated tube or burette filled completely with
water is inverted over the end of the delivery tube in a
trough of water.

Fig. 3.6 To show that water contains dissolved gases

Observation : Heat the water in the flask. Gas
bubbles are seen escaping from water. They are
collected in the graduated tube by downward
displacement of water. The water vapour present in the
gases condenses on coming in contact with the cold
water in the tube. Obviously, the remaining gases come
from the air dissolved in water, and they escape on
heating. Read the volume.of the gas thus collected. The
volume of the gas (air) collected in the graduated tube
shows the presence of dissolved gases in tap water.

The solubility of a gas is often expressed by the
volume of that gas dissolved in a certain volume of
a solvent. For example, the solubility of H, in water

is expressed as 0-02 volime of hydrogen per unit
volume of water, at 0°C or 506 volumes of hydrogen
chloride per unit volume of water, at 0°C.

The composition of air dissolved in water is 33%
oxygen (compared to 21% in ordinary air), 66%
nitrogen and 1% carbon dioxide.

Note : Distilled water and boiled water have no taste.

The pleasant taste of drinking water is due to the
presence of dissolved matter, like air, carbon dioxide
and minerals.

IMPORTANCE OF AIR DISSOLVED IN WATER

Air dissolved in water is biologically very
important.

(1) Marine life, like fish, use the oxygen of the air
dissolved in water for respiration, and thus aquatic
life is sustained. 1 dm? of water contains nearly
40 cm? of dissolved oxygen.

(2) Carbon dioxide
(i) Aquatic plants make use of dissolved carbon
dioxide for photosynthesis, i.e. to prepare

their food.

3 B. SOLUTIONS

3.4 SOLUTIONS AS MIXTURES OF SOLIDS
IN WATER

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or
more components whose composition may be

gradually changed by changing the relative
amounts of the components.

Solution = Solute + Solvent

The medium of dissolution that allows one or
more component to dissolve in it to form a solution
is known as SOLVENT. The substance that dissolves
in the solvent to form a solution is known as
SOLUTE.

A solution which is made up of two
components is a binary solution. Solutions which
are made up of three or four components are called
ternary and quaternary solutions respectively.
Here we shall deal with binary solutions only,
composed of a solute and a solvent.

For example : When salt crystals dissolve in
water to form saline water, the salt is classified as
the solute, the water is classified as the solvent and
the saline water is an example of a solution.

If the components exist in different physical
States, then the solvent is that component which exists
in the same phase (state) as the final solution.

For example, if sugar is dissolved in water, the
final solution is a liquid solution. So water (liquid)
is the solvent and sugar the solute.

If the two substances are in the same phase
(state), the component that is in excess is termed the
solvent.

A solution may be formed by mixing :
(i) a liquid with another liquid

Water and alcohol

(ii) a solid with a liquid

Example :
Example : Sugar solution
(ili) a liquid with a gas.
Example :
(iv) a solid with another solid
Example : Alloys
A homogeneous solution of a solid into
another solid is called a solid solution. Common
metal alloys are solid solutions. The gold used in

making jewellery is a solid solution containing gold
and small quantities of copper or silver.

Soda water

Brass is a solid solution containing 70%
copper and 30% zinc. Here, copper acts as the
solvent and zinc as the solute.

A solution in which the size of the solute particles
is about 10-' m is called a true solution. In a true
solution, the solute particles and the solvent molecules
cannot be distinguished even under a microscope. In
common use, the term solution actually means true
solution.

a


--- Page 6 ---
Characteristics of a true solution (or simply a
solution)

1. It is a homogeneous mixture.

2. The solute particles are very small, about
10° m.

. It is clear and transparent.
. It does not scatter light.
. Its components cannot be separated by filtration.

Nn nA fb WD

. The solute particles in a solution do not settle down.

Note:

. Water is the most common solvent (a solution
produced by dissolving a substance in water is
known as an aqueous solution) but it is not the only
solvent. Alcohol, petrol, ether, benzene, carbon
disulphide, liquid ammonia, efc. are some

non-aqueous liquid solvents in common use. The
solutions made in these liquids are known as non-
aqueous solutions.

. When the solvent is alcohol, the solution is called a
tincture. Tincture of iodine is a solution of iodine in
alcohol.

Dilute solution

It is the solution in which the amount of solute
is rather small compared to the mass of the solvent.

Concentrated solution

It is the solution in which the amount of solute
is relatively large for 4 given mass of the solvent.

3.5 SATURATED SOLUTION

A solution that cannot dissolve any more of the
solute at a given temperature is called a saturated
solution.

Preparation of a saturated solution

Experiment : Take 100 g of distilled water in a
beaker. Add 1 g of nitre and stir with a glass rod till
the nitre dissolves. Add one gram more of nitre and
stir it. It too will dissolve. Continue adding a gram
of nitre at a time, and stir vigorously after each
addition. A stage will come when no more of the
nitre will dissolve at that temperature, no matter how
long it is left there or how vigorously it is stirred.
The solution is then said to be saturated with nitre
at that temperature. This is the saturated solution of

nitre in water adn it cannot dissolve any more of the
solute without changing temperature.

A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute
in a solvent; its composition may vary till a

saturated solution is obtained at a particular
temperature.

Effect of cooling on a saturated solution

The solubility of a solid usually decreases with
fall in temperature. Thus, if the temperature of a
saturated solution is lowered, or if a solution is
left open at a higher temperature for long, (the
solvent slowly vaporizes) and a part of the dissolved
solute separates out in the form of crystals. The
remaining solution is still a saturated solution but at
a lower temperature.

A saturated solution can also be made unsaturated
by adding more solvent to it.

Unsaturated solution

A solution in which more of the solute can be

dissolved at a given temperature is known
as an unsaturated solution.

Supersaturated solution

A solution that holds more solute than it
can theoretically do at room temperature is a
supersaturated solution. Heat a saturated solution
and dissolve some more solute to it. Then cool it
back to room temperature; you will get a
supersaturated solution since it holds more solute
than it can theoretically hold at that temperature.

A supersaturated solution at a particular
temperature is one that is more concentrated
(contains more solute) than its saturated solution
at that temperature.

Preparation of supersaturated solutions

A saturated solution of a solute, say potassium
nitrate, is prepared in slightly warm water. On cooling
this solution, the excess nitre does not separate out.
This solution contains more solute in it than it can
hold at room temperature, and therefore it is a
supersaturated solution.


--- Page 7 ---
Note : It is possible to bring down the temperature

of a saturated solution a little without the excess

solute crystallizing out, if :

(i) no suspended impurities, like dust particles,
are present in it.

(ii) the solution is not disturbed physically, i.e. it is

left standing still in its container.

3.6 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION

Concentration of a solution is the amount of solute
dissolved in a given quantity of that solution. It can
be expressed in many ways. For example :

(i) Mass percent

It is defined as the mass of solid solute in grams
present in 100 grams of the solution. It is mostly used
when solute is solid and solvent is liquid.

Concentration of solution

Mass of solute
~ Mass of solution (solute + solvent)

x 100

For example, if 10 grams of sodium chloride
is added to 90 grams of water, the concentration

10 10
= 10490 x 100 = 100 x 100 = 10%.

(ii) Volume percent

It is defined as the volume of solute in millilitres
present in 100 mL of a solution. It is mostly used when
solute and solvent are liquid.

Volume percent
Volume of solute
= Volume of solute + Volume of solvent
For example, if 30 mL of alcohol is mixed
with 70 mL of water to get 100 mL of solution, volume
percent

x 100

30 30
= 30470 x 100= 100 x 100 = 30%

Solved examples :

Example | : 2-5 litres of alcohol is present in 10
litres of aqueous solution of alcohol. Calculate volume
percent.

Volume of solute = 2-5 litres
Volume of solution = 10-0 litres

Solution : Volume percent
Volume of Solute

x 100

~ Volume of solution

= 70 * 100 = 25%
Example 2 : 50 gram of sugar is dissolved in 2-45

kg of water. Calculate the concentration of solution.

Solution : Mass of solute = 50 gram,

mass of solvent = 2450 gram,

mass of solution = mass of solute + mass of
solvent = 2500 gram

Mass of solute x 100

Mass% = Mass of solution
Mass% = —2- x 100 = 2% solution
assfo = Fo05 = 2% solu

3.7 SOLUBILITY

Different substances dissolve to different extents
in the same volume of a given solvent. In other
words, they have different solubilities. For example,
the masses of sodium chloride and potassium nitrate
that dissolve in 100 g of water at 40°C are 36.5 g
and 65 g respectively. Obviously, the solubility of
potassium nitrate is greater than that of sodium
chloride.

The solubility of a solute in a particular solvent at
a given temperature is equivalent to the maximum
number of grams of the solute necessary to saturate
100 g of that solvent at that temperature.

A substance that has negligible solubility is
called insoluble, e.g., silver chloride, which has
0-000015 g as its solubility. On the other hand, a
substance that has more than negligible but less
than high solubility is called sparingly soluble,
e.g. calcium hydroxide, which has 0-17 g as its
solubility. A substance having high solubility such
as sodium chloride is simply called soluble.

Determination of the solubility of a solute at a
particular temperature

1. Note the temperature of the saturated solution.

2. Weigh a clean, dry evaporating dish = M.

3. Put the saturated solution in it and weigh —
again = M,.

renee 27 Ba


--- Page 8 ---
4. Now heat the solution to dryness and again
weigh = M,.

5. Mass of saturated solution = M, - M.

6. Mass of solute = M, - M.

7. Mass of solvent = Mass of saturated solution
— mass of solute = (M, — M) - (M, - M)
At the noted temperature :

Solubility = asso! solute, 199
Mass of solvent
M,-M

= (M,-M)—(M, -M) * 100
3.7.1 Factors affecting solubility

The rate of dissolution or rate of solubility of a
solid in a liquid depends on the following factors :

(a) Size of solute particles : The smaller the size of
the solute particles, the greater is its total
surface area exposed to the solvent. Therefore,
the greater is the solubility of that solute.

(b) Stirring : This brings more of the solvent in
contact with the solute and thus increases the
rate of formation of solution.

(c) Temperature : The solubility of a gas in a
liquid always decreases with rise in
temperature. But the solubility of most solids
in water usually increases with rise in
temperature.

For example, the solubility of potassium nitrate
in water at 20°C is 31-6 grams, whereas its
solubility at 60°C is 63-9 grams.

All these factors affect solubility because in
process of dissolution, the particles of solute
merely occupies the spaces between particles of
solvent without undergoing chemical change.

3.7.2 Solubility curves

A solubility curve is a line graph that plots
changes in solubility of a solute in a solvent against
changing temperature.

Variation in solubility of a given substance with
temperature can be shown by means of solubility
curves. Here, solubility is plotted along the ordinate
(y-axis) and temperature along the abscissa (x-axis).
Solubility curves of some common compounds are
shown in Fig. 3.7.

Fig. 3.7 Variation in solubility of some
solids with changing temperature

(i) Solubility curves of substances like calcium
sulphate (CaSO,-2H,O) show that there is a
decrease (after attaining a certain temperature) in
their solubilities with further rise in temperature.
Other examples are ceric sulphate Ce,(SO,),, slaked
lime Ca(OH),, etc.

(ii) Substances like sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate,
potassium bromide, etc., show considerable
increase in their solubilities with rise in
temperature.

(iii) Solubility of sodium chloride increases only a little
with increase in temperature.

In an endothermic process the solubility of
solute increase with the increase of temperature. For
example solubility KNO, increases with rise in

temperature. In an enothermic process, the solubility
increases on lowering the temperature. For example,
solubility by calcium hydroxide in water decreases
on increasing the temperature.

Anomalous solubility :

There are some salts whose solubilities first increase,
and then decrease, with rise in temperature.

For example : Na,SO, . 10H,O (Glauber salt)

Solubility curve of Na,SO,.10H,O rises till it
reaches 32-8°C, and then it falls slightly. This is
because Na,SO,.10H,O is hydrous below 32-8°C and
anhydrous above it (Fig. 3.8).

3.7.3, Applications of solubility curves

(a) Shape of the curve indicates how the solubility
of the given substance in a solvent varies with
change in temperature. The solubility of a
substance at a particular temperature can be
determined from the curve.

(b) Solubilities of different solutes in a solvent at
different temperatures can be compared by
comparing at their respective solubility curves
plotted on the same chart (Fig. 3.7).

(c) The effect of cooling of hot solutions of different

substances can be found from the curves.
When a saturated solution is prepared at 40°C
and then it is cooled to 15°C, some salts gets
precipitated out. On the other hand, if a saturated
solution is heated to a higher temperature, then
it becomes unsaturated. More solute can be
dissolved in this solution now.

Some solved examples :

Example 1 :

12 g of a saturated solution of potassium chloride at
20°C, when evaporated to dryness, leaves a solid residue
of 3 g. Calculate the solubility of potassium chloride.

Solution :
Weight of water in solution = 12 g-3 g=9g
9 g of H,O dissolves 3 g of solid

. 100 g of water will dissolve
3
9* 100 = 33-3 g
Ans. Solubility of KCl in H,O at 20°C = 33-3 g

Example 2 :

Find the weight of sodium nitrate required to
prepare 60 g pure crystals from its saturated solution
at 70°C. Solubility of sodium nitrate is 140 g at 70°C
and 100 g at 25°C.

Solubility at 70°C = 140
Solubility at 25°C = 100
Amount of crystals obtained when the solution is
cooled from 70°C to 25°C
= 140-100 =40¢
To obtain 40 g of crystals, sodium nitrate taken is

To obtain 60 g crystals, sodium nitrate required will

Solution :

3.7.4 Effect of pressure and temperature on
solubility of gases in water (liquids)
Pressure : An increase in pressure on the surface
of water increases the solubility of a gas in water.

At any given temperature, the mass of gas dissolved
by a fixed volume of liquid is directly proportional
to the pressure on the surface of the liquid. This law
is known as Henry’s Law.

For example, the solubility of carbon dioxide in
water under normal atmospheric pressure is rather low,
but when the water surface is subjected to higher
pressure a lot more of CO, gas dissolves in it, as is
seen in the case of soda water. On opening the soda
water bottle, the dissolved gas rapidly bubbles out since
pressure on the surface of water suddenly decreases.

Temperature : An increase in temperature of
water causes a decrease in solubility of a gas in it.
Thus, on boiling, water loses its taste. Since some taste
of water is due to the gases in it, on boiling, these
gases escape from water, leaving it tasteless.

3.8 CRYSTALS AND CRYSTALLIZATION

A crystal is a homogeneous solid of definite
geometrical shape. It has symmetrically arranged
smooth plane surfaces which meet forming the sharp
edges.

Crystallization is a process by which crystals
of a substance are obtained by cooling a hot
saturated solution.

All crystals of a pure compound are of similar
shape, but those of different compounds may be of
different shapes. Some shapes in which crystals exist
are :

Cubic (e.g., NaCl)


--- Page 10 ---
RhombohedriT (€.2.; Cusuyy
Octahedral (e.g., FeSO,)
Prismatic, with sharp edges (e.g., KNO,)

FOI

CUBIC = RHOMBOHEDRIC OCTAHEDRAL PRISMATIC
Fig. 3.9 Some shapes of crystals

In nature too, several crystals are formed, some
of which are recovered from the earth as minerals,
e.g. common salt, potassium nitrate, ruby, saphire,
diamond. In some cases, their beautiful colours are
due to traces of water or impurities present in them.
For example, the red colour of ruby is due to a
trace of mercury oxide present in its crystals.

_ Ina laboratory, crystals may be obtained by the

following methods :

(1) By cooling a hot saturated solution

(2) By slowly evaporating a saturated solution

(3) By cooling a fused mass

(4) By sublimation
Experiment : To prepare large crystals of copper
sulphate.

Procedure : Make a saturated solution of copper
sulphate at 80°C. Filter it. Allow the filtrate to cool
and leave it for a day. Next morning, a number of tiny
crystals will be seen lying at the bottom of the beaker.
Pick up these small crystals, which are well formed.
Now, suspend a well-shaped crystal by means of a
thread tied to a glass rod into the cooled saturated
solution (Fig. 3.10). Cover the beaker with a piece of
paper to prevent dust from getting in. Leave the beaker
undisturbed and watch the crystal grow.

crystal acts as a seed crystal.

This process of inducing crystallization by
adding a crystal of a pure substance into its saturated
solution is called seeding.

Caution : Avoid addition of dust particles, or
crystals will form around them as well.

3.9 HYDRATED AND ANHYDROUS SUBSTANCES

Substances which contain water molecules
along with salts like sodium carbonate decahydrate
(NaCO,-10H,O) and copper sulphate pentahydrate
(CuSO,-5H,O) are hydrated substances.

Substances which do not contain any water
along with the salts are anhydrous substances. For
example sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium nitrate
(KNO,) etc.

3.9.1 Hydrated substances

The crystals of some salts contain water of
crystallisation. This water gives the crystals their
shape. In some cases it also gives them their colour
(copper sulphate crystals are blue in colour). Such salts
are known as hydrated salts.

WATER OF CRYSTALLIZATION

The fixed amount of water that is associated
with hydrated crystals which is an integral part of
the crystal, is called water of crystallisation.

Some solids, while crystallizing out from their
solutions, combine with a definite quantity of water,
known as water of crystallization or water of hydration.

This water of crystallization is in loose chemical
combination and can be driven off as steam by
heating the crystals above 100°C, the vapours
produced are condensed and the liquid formed is
tested. This liquid gives test of water. In this
process, the crystals lose their water and become
anhydrous, i.e. all the water combined in the
crystalline material is removed.

Experiment : To show that hydrated copper
sulphate crystals (blue vitriol) contain water of
crystallization.

Procedure : Take some powdered copper sulphate
crystals in a clean dry test tube, and clamp it in a tilted
position (Fig. 6.11) so that the condensed water does
not trickle or flow back. Gently heat the crystals.

Observation : Drops of colourless liquid
condense on the cooler parts of the test tube, leaving
behind a residue that is anhydrous (without water) and
amorphous (non-crystalline), i.e. with no definite
shape or structure.

When preparing crystals of a hydrated salt, we
must be careful not to heat them too strongly when
drying them, otherwise the product is a dehydrated
powder, not crystals.

Determination of water of crystallization

Take a known weight of crystals in a china dish

and heat it above 100°C. When the weight of the
residue becomes constant, stop heating.

Wt. of crystals at room temperature = a g

Wt. of crystals after heating at 101°C = b g

Wt. of water = (a — b) g

Now a g of crystals contain water = (a — b) g

—b
.. % of water of crystallization = — x 100

3.9.2 Anhydrous substances

A substance is anhydrous if it contains no water,
for example, salts lacking their water of crystallisation.
The term ‘Anhydrous’. is most often applied to
crystalline substances when the water of crystallisation
is removed.

Anhydrous can also refer to the gaseous form of

some concentrated solutions such as ammonia to
distinguish it from its aqueons solution form.

Anhydrous solvents are used to perform
certain chemical reactions that cannot proceed
in presence of water. Examples of anhydrous
substances.

* Table salt is anhydrous sodium chloride.

¢ Gaseous HCI is anhydrous.

Anhydrous salts can be obtained from hydrated
salts by carefully removing the water of crystallisation
from them. It can be done by

¢ Direct heating.

¢ Heating in dry and hot air.

¢ Heating under vacuum.

¢ By using dehydrating/desicating agents such

as warm concentrated sulphuric acid.

The crystalline shape of a substance is not
necessarily the result of the presence of water of
crystallization. In fact, there are a number of crystalline.
solids that crystallize from water without holding any
water of crystallization.

Examples of crystalline substance which do
not contain water of crystallization :

Common salt (NaCl),
Nitre (KNO,),

Sugar (C,,H,,0,)),
Potassium permanganate (KMnO,),
Ammonium chloride (NH,C1).



--- Page 12 ---
Experiment : To study the action of heat on
anhydrous crystals of sodium chloride and potassium
nitrate.

Procedure : Gently heat a few crystals of pure
sodium chloride (common salt) in one test tube and a
few crystals of potassium nitrate in another.

Observation : On heating, crystals of sodium
chloride produce a crackling sound, called
decrepitation. This is due to the breaking of bigger
crystals of sodium chloride into smaller ones. On the
other hand, crystals of potassium nitrate first melt
into a colourless liquid, and then, on strong heating,
they produce oxygen, which rekindles a glowing
splint. Potassium nitrite, a light yellow solid residue,
is left behind.

2KNO, — 2KNO, + 0,T

nitrate nitrite (light yellow solid)

Conclusion : Both the substances do not contain

water of crystallization.

3.10 PROPERTIES
3.10.1 Efflorescence

A phenomenon where a compound loses its water
of crystallisation on exposure to dry air is called
efflorescency. This results in loss of crystalline shape,
and finally the crumbling of crytals into a powder.

Substances showing efflorescence are called
efflorescent substances.

Efflorescence occurs when vapour pressure in the
hydrated crystals exceeds atmospheric vapour
pressure. Thus, it is minimized during humid
conditions.

Examples of efflorescent substances :
(a) Washing soda [hydrated sodium carbonate],
when exposed to dry air, becomes a monohydrate.

Na,CO;-10H,0_9ry air_, Na,CO;.H,O + 9H,O

(b) Glauber’s salt [hydrated sodium sulphate,
Na,SO,.10H,O] becomes a powdery anhydrous
sodium sulphate when exposed to air.
NaSO,-10H,O_4ry air_, Na,SO, + 10H,O

(c) Epsom salt [magnesium sulphate heptahydrate],
when exposed to dry air, becomes a monohydrate.
MgSO,-7H,O _4ry air_, MgSO,-H,O + 6H,O

Note : The higher the temperature of the air, the
higher the efflorescence. This is because the air
absorbs more water with rising temperature and
decreasing moisture.

3.10.2 Deliquescence

Certain water soluble substances, when exposed
to the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures, absorb
moisture from atmospheric air, become moist, lose
their crystalline form, and ultimately dissolve in the
absorbed water, forming a saturated solution. Such
a substance is called a deliquescent substance and
the phenomenon is called deliquescency.

Deliquescence occurs when vapour pressure
inside the crystals is very low compared to vapour
pressure in the atmospheric air. Thus, deliquescence
is minimized during dry conditions.

Deliquescent substances

Example of caustic soda NaOH, caustic potash KOH,
magnesium chloride MgCl, zinc chloride ZnCl,, calcium
chloride CaCl, and ferric chloride FeC],.

Note : Table salt [sodium chloride] turns moist
and ultimately forms a solution, on exposure to air
[especially during the rainy season]. Though pure
sodium chloride is not deliquescent, the
commercial version of the salt contains impurities,
like magnesium chloride and calcium chloride,
which are deliquescent substances.

This kind of impurity can be removed by
passing a current of dry hydrogen chloride gas
through a saturated solution of the affected salt.
Pure sodium chloride is produced as a
precipitate, which can be recovered by filtering
and washing first with a little water and finally
with alcohol.

3.10.3 Hygroscopic Substances

Certain substances absorb moisture (water
vapour) from the atmosphere when they are exposed
to it. Such substances are called hygroscopic
substances. The phenomenon is known as hygroscopy.

Some examples of hygroscopic substances are :

(i) Conc. sulphuric acid (H,SO,)

(ii) Phosphorus pentoxide (P,O,)

(iii) Quicklime (CaO)


--- Page 13 ---
Hygroscopic substances have a tendency to take
up moisture from the air.

3.11 DRYING AND DEHYDRATING AGENTS

Drying agents are substances that can readily
absorb moisture from other substances without
chemically reacting with them.

For example, anhydrous calcium chloride,
anhydrous zinc chloride, phosphorus pentoxide,
magnesium sulphate, dry sodium sulphate, etc., are used
to absorb water vapour from the air.

These substances are also called desiccants or
desiccating agents.

Almost all hygroscopic substances are
desiccating agents, e.g. conc. sulphuric acid,
phosphorus pentoxide, silica gel, quicklime.

Dehydrating agents are substances that can
remove even the chemically combined water
molecules from compounds. For example,
conc. sulphuric acid can remove water molecules
from blue vitriol (CuSO,.5H,O). Therefore, it is a
dehydrating agent.

Cone H_SO

CuSO, - SH,0 ——————> CuSO, + 5H,O
(blue) (white)

Gases are dried by :

(i) Passing the gases through conc. sulphuric acid
conc. sulphuric acid has strong affinity for water,
so it easily extracts water from many substances
[Fig. 3.12(a)].

Conc. Sulphuric acid is used to dry gases which

(b)

are acidic in nature like hydrogen chloride gas.
(ii) Passing them through a drying tower or a
U-tube containing anhydrous sodium sulphate
[Fig. 3.12(b) and Fig. 3.12(c)].
(iii) A drying bulb containing anhydrous calcium
chloride [Fig. 3.12(d)].

Quicklime being basic in nature is suitable for
drying NH,, a basic gas. Basic gas will not react
with a base.

Liquids are dried by keeping them overnight
over anhydrous Na,SO, or MgSO, or CaCl, at
room temperature. The solid is then removed by
filtration.

Solids are dried by spreading them on a watch
glass or a dish and keeping it in a desiccator
for some days.

A desiccator is an air-tight glass vessel with a
suitable drying agent (anhydrous calcium chloride)
placed at the bottom. It is used for drying the solids
placed in it.

3 C. SOFT AND HARD WATER

3.12 SOFT AND HARD WATER

Water is said to be soft, if it readily forms lather
with soap. Pure water or water containing sodium salts
easily gives lather with soap. Such a water sample is
called ‘soft water’ and is suitable for use. Distilled
water and rain water are example of soft water.

Water is said to be hard when it does not readily
form lather with soap.

3.12.1 Causes of hardness

Water of some springs, wells and rivers contain
dissolved mineral matter. If this happens to be the

few suds

hydrogen carbonates, sulphates or chlorides of calcium
and magnesium, the water gets hard.

Hard water contains bicarbonates, chlorides

or sulphates of calcium or magnesium.

When water flows over beds of limestone and
dolomite (CaCO,, MgCO,) carbon dioxide slowly
converts some of these into soluble calcium and
magnesium bicarbonates which get mixed with the
water and make it hard. The formation of stalactities
and stalagmites in caves is due to the same reason.

Stalagmites and stalactites : In some lime-stone
caves, One sometimes sees conical pillar like objects,
some hanging from the roof of the caves and some
rising from their floors. These are formed by water
dropping from the cracks in the rocks, containing
dissolved calcium hydrogen carbonate. Release of
pressure results in the conversion of some hydrogen
carbonate to calcium carbonate.

Ca(HCO,), + CaCO, + CO, + H,O
This calcium carbonate, little by little gets
deposited both on the roof and floor of the cave.



--- Page 16 ---
The conical pillar which grows downwards
from the roof is called Stalacite and the one which
grows upward from the floor of the cave is called
stalagmite (Fig. 3.15).

If water flows over beds of gypsum (CaSO,,
2H,0), a little bit of gypsum gets dissolved in water
and makes it hard.

3.13 TYPES OF HARDNESS TEMPORARY AND
PERMANENT HARDNESS

Hardness of water is of two types : temporary
hardness and permanent hardness. Water that contains
only hydrogen carbonates of calcium and magnesium
is called temporary hard water.

It is called temporary hard water because its
hardness can be removed just by boiling.

Ca(HCO,), _Boil_, CaCO,/ + H,O + CO,T

Mg(HCO,), _Boil_, MgCO,/ + H,O + CO,T

The calcium ions and magnesium ions are thus
removed from the water by the formation of insoluble
calcium carbonate and hence the water becomes soft.

Water containing sulphates and chloride of
magnesium and calcium is called permanent hard
water. This hardness can not be removed by boiling.

Note : The removing of temporary hardness of
water by boiling is, however, not a practical method;
it is costly and slow.

3.13.1 Advantages of hard water

Hard water containing some dissolved salts has
the following advantages.

(i) Soft water free from dissolved salts has a very
flat taste. The presence of salts in hard water
makes it tasty. Hard water is therefore, used in
the preparation of beverages and wines.

(ii) Calcium and magnesium salts present in small
amounts in hard water are essential for the
growth of our bones and teeth.

(iii) Hard water checks the poisoning of water by
lead pipes. When these pipes are used for
carrying water, some lead salts dissolve in
water to make it poisonous calcium sulphate
present in hard water forms insoluble lead
sulphate in the form of a layer inside the lead
pipe and this checks the lead poisoning.

3.13.2 Disadvantages of hard water
Hard water is not suitable for producing steam

Steam is usually made in boilers which are made
up of a number of narrow copper tubes surrounded by
fire. As the cold water enters these tubes, it is
immediately changed into steam, while the dissolved
solids incapable of changing into vapour get deposited
on the inner walls of the tubes. This goes on and thus
making the bore of the tubes narrower and narrower
(Fig. 3.16). The result is that less water flows through
the tubes at one time and less steam is produce.

Fig. 3.16 Boiler scales due to hard water

When the bore of the tube becomes very narrow,
the pressure of steam increases so much that at times
the boiler itself bursts. Not only that, the boiler scale
formed inside the tube being a bad conductor of heat
allows only part of the outside heat to go in and convert
the water into steam. This results in further loss of
heat. To minimise the loss, the boiler scale is removed
from time to time by using a boiler compound or else
water is first softened and then used. Both cost money.


--- Page 17 ---
The furring of the tea kettle is also caused by
the sediment formed on its walls from boiling hard
water. This fur is nothing but carbonates of calcium
and magnesium.

Hard water is also unit for washing purposes

For washing purposes soap is invariably used.
Soap is chemically a sodium salt of stearic acid (an
organic acid, formula C,,H;,;COOH) and has the
formula C,,H,;;COONa. If the water is hard, the
calcium and magnesium ions of the water combine
with the negative ions of the soap to form a slimy
precipitate of insoluble calcium and magnesium
usually given the name of soap-curd or scum.

2NaSt + Ca(HCO,), = CaSt,d + 2NaHCO,

(soap)

The formation of soap-curd will go on as long as
there are calcium and magnesium ions present. Till
then no soap lather will be formed and cleaning of
cloth or body will not be possible. Moreover these
precipitates are difficult to wash out from the fabrics
and sometimes form rusty spots if iron salts are also
present in water.

(soap curd)

This difficulty has been solved to a great extent
by using synthetic detergents.

Synethetic detergents such as SURF, DET, etc.,
are used in place of soap in domestic and laundry work.
These are made by sulphonating some higher alkenes
(organic compounds) with sulphuric acid and then
converting them into their sodium salts by caustic
soda. These sodium salts are called the detergents.

Detergents are more soluble in water than soap
and are unaffected by hardness of water as their
calcium salts are soluble in water.

Cleansing action of soaps and detergents

When a soap or detergents is dissolved in water,
the molecules gather as clusters called micelles. The
tails stick inwards and the head outwards.

In cleansing, the hydrocarbon tail attaches itself
to oily dirt. When water is stirred, the oily dirt tends
to lift off from the dirty surface and dissociates into
fragments. This gives an opportunity to other tails to

‘Stick to oil. The solution now contains small globules
of oil surrounded by detergent molecules. The
negatively charged heads present in water prevent the

small globules from coming together and form
aggregates. Thus, the oily dirt is removed from the
object.

Fig. 3.17 Cleaning action of soap

3.13.3. Removal of hardness

Removal of temporary hardness :

(1) By boiling, carbon dioxide is driven off and
the soluble hydrogen carbonates are converted into
insoluble carbonates and could be removed by
filtration or decantation.

Ca(HCO,), > CaCO,1 + H,0 + CO,T

Calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are
precipitated leaving the water soft.

This is, however, not very practical when large
quantities of water are concerned.

(2) By addition of lime (Clark’s Process).

A more practical method is to add a calculated
quantity of slaked lime. The following reaction takes
place.

Ca(HCO,), + Ca(OH), — 2CaCO,1 + 2H,0
Mg(HCO,), + Ca(OH), > MgCO,1 + CaCO,J + 2H,O

Lime is first thoroughly mixed with water in a
tank and then fed into another tank containing the hard
water. Revolving paddles thoroughly mix the two
solutions. Most of the calcium carbonate settles down.
If there is any solid left over it is removed by a filter.
The process goes by the name of Clarke’s process.

(3) By the addition of washing soda.

When washing soda or soda ash is added to hard
water, the corresponding insoluble carbonates settle
down and can be removed by filtration.

Ca(HCO,), + Na,CO, CaCO,J + 2NaHCO,
Mg(HCO,), + Na,CO, > MgCO,\ + 2NaHCO,

treated with a calculated quantity of soda ash, when

CaCl, + Na,CO, > CaCO, + 2NaCl

If, however, some magnesium sulphate is also
present in the water, lime has also to be used besides
soda ash, as magesium carbonate is not fully
precipitated. In that case the reaction will be

MgSO, + Na,CO, + Ca(OH),
— Mg(OH),J + CaCO,J + Na,SO,
Magnesium hydroxide is less soluble than
magnesium carbonate.

Note : The above methods are suitable, for
domestic purposes only when small amounts of water
have to be treated.

If hardness is both temporary and permanent.
In such a case, particularly when large amounts of
water are concerned, the permutit process is used.

Permutit is an artificial zeolite. Chemically, it is
hydrated sodium aluminium orthosilicate, having the

formula Na,Al,Si,0,-XH,O. For the sake of
convenience let us give it the formula Na,P.

Fig. 3.19 Softening of hard water by permit it

A tall cylinder is loosely filled with lumps of
permutit. When hard water containing calcium and
magnesium ions percolates through these lumps,
exchange of ions takes place. The sodium permutit is
slowly changed into calcium and magnesium permutit,
and with the removal of calcium and magnesium ions,
the water becomes soft.

When no longer active, the permutit is regenerated
by running a concentrated solution of brine over it
and removing the calcium chloride formed by repeated
washing.

CaP + 2NaCl > Na,P + Cal,

Softening hard water, using ion exchange resins

For laundries and boilers, water softened by the
permutit process is quite satisfactory.

For scientific purposes even the presence of +ve
sodium ion and —ve bicarbonate and sulphate ions is not
desirable. To remove these ions, the water is passed
through synthetically prepared cation (+ve ion) and anion
(—ve ion) exchange resins one by one. The sodium ions
are replaced by H+ ions and HCO,” and SO,” ions by
OH ions and the water gets completely deionised.
