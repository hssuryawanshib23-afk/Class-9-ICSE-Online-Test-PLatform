CHEMICAL CHANGES AND REACTIONS

SYLLABUS

(i) Types of chemical changes.
¢ Direct combination * decomposition

2.1 CHEMICAL REACTION

A chemical reaction is the process of breaking
the chemical bonds of the reacting substances
(reactants) and making new bonds to form new
substances (products).

A chemical bond is the force that holds the atoms of
a molecule together, as in a compound.

A chemical change or chemical reaction occurs
when particles collide. Collisions occur when
reactants are in close contact or by supply of energy.
Thus, one or more of the following conditions are
necessary for a chemical change :

(i) Mixing (close contact) : In some cases, a
chemical reaction occurs when two substances are
mixed in their solid states.

Example 1 : Yodine and phosphorus react
explosively when brought into close contact.

2 : Lead nitrate (white) and potassium iodide
(white) react to make lead iodide (yellow).

Pb(NO3), (s) + 2K1 (s) + 2KNO, (s) + Pbl, (s)

(ti) Solution : In some cases, a chemical reaction
occurs when substances are mixed in, i.e. molten or
aqueous state.

Example 1] : Oxalic acid crystals and’ sodium
carbonate react in water solution only.

2 : Sodium chloride and silver nitrate also react
in a solution state to form the precipitate of silver
chloride and sodium nitrate.

(ii) Energy changes in a chemical change.
Exothermic and endothermic reactions with examples — evolution/absorption of heat, light and electricity.

* double decomposition

(iii) Heat : Some chemical reactions occur only
on heating.

Example 1 : Copper carbonate decomposes on
heating (A symbol for heating) into copper oxide and
carbon dioxide.

CuCO,(s) —*> CuO (s) + COn(g)

2 : Lead nitrate decomposes on heating leaving
yellow residue lead monoxide, brown gas nitrogen
dioxide and colourless gas oxygen.

2Pb(NO;)) —“~ 2PbO + 4NO, + 0,

(iv) Light : Some chemical reactions take place
by the action of light. These are called photochemical
reactions or photolysis. Molecules of the reactants
absorb light energy to get activated, and then react
rapidly.

Example 1 : Plants form glucose from carbon
dioxide and water in the presence of light.

6CO, + 6H,0 > CcH).0, + 60,

2 : Hydrogen and chlorine react in the presence

of sunlight.

H, + Cl —*> 2HCI

3 : If chlorine water is exposed to sunlight,
oxygen is evolved.

Cl, + H,O > HCI + HCIO

Note : Solutions of silver nitrate, hydrogen ‘per
oxide are kept in brown bottles in the laboratory
because they decompose in the presence of light.

4 : Silver nitrate decomposes in the presence of
light. ;
2Agno, —SUAlight , 245 4 2NO, +0,

(v) Electricity : Certain chemical reactions, like
the decomposition of certain compounds, occur only
when electricity is passed through the substance.

Example 1 : Electrolysis of acidulated water
occurs only in the presence of electricity, to give
hydrogen and oxygen.

2H,0 electricity, oH 4 0,
2 : On passing current through molten sodium
chloride, sodium and chlorine are separately obtained.

2nac} —Clectricity ona 4 Cl,

(vi) Pressure : Some chemical reactions take
place only when the involved substances are
subjected to high pressure.

Example 1 : Mercuric chloride and potassium
iodide when rubbed in a mortar, give a scarlet-
coloured substance called mercuric iodide.

2 : Nitrogen and hydrogen, when subjected to
high pressure, produce ammonia (in the presence of
iron as catalyst)

N, + 3H, === 2NH,
above 200 atm

(vii) Catalyst : Some chemical reactions need a
catalyst to accelerate or decelerate the rate at which
they ocour. The catalysts themselves do not take part
in the reaction.

Example | : Potassium chlorate decomposes only
at 700°C, and even then the rate of release of oxygen
is very slow. But when potassium chlorate is heated
in the presence of manganese dioxide, decomposition
begins at a much lower temperature, 300°C, and
manganese dioxide remains unaffected. Thus, in this
reaction, manganese dioxide acts as a catalyst.

2 : Ammonia reacts with oxygen to produce
nitric oxide and water vapour in the presence of
(platinum) a catalyst.

ANH, + 50) Gogo? 4NO + 6H0

(a) Positive catalyst

When a catalyst accelerates a reaction, it is
known as a positive catalyst.

For example, the rate of decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide gets increased in the presence of
manganese dioxide.

MnO,
2H,0, —————> 2H,0 + O,

Promoters : Substances that influence the rate
of a chemical reaction by improving the efficiency of the
catalyst are called promoters.

For example, in the manufacture of ammonia, iron
acts as a catalyst and molybdenum as a promoter.

Molybdenum increases the efficiency of the catalyst iron.

molybdenum
(b) Negative catalyst
A catalyst employed to retard a reaction is known
as a negative catalyst.

Example 1 : Phosphoric acid retards the rate of
decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.

2NH;

2 : The rate of oxidation of chloroform decreases
in the presence of alcohol.

Note : Certain chemical reactions proceed by
absorption of sound energy.

For example : Acetylene breaks up into carbon

and hydrogen by absorbing sound energy:

2.22 CHARACTERISTICS

REACTIONS

Certain chemical reactions are characterized by
changes that are quite easily observed. Some of these
typical changes are :

(i) Evolution of gas : In many chemical
reactions, one of the products is a gas.
Examples :

OF CHEMICAL

(a) When zinc reacts with dilute sulphuric acid,
hydrogen gas is evolved, with an effervescence.
Zn + H,SO, => ZnSO, + H,
[zinc] [dil. sulphuric [zinc sulphate] [hydrogen]
acid]


--- Page 3 ---
Effervescence : The formation of gas bubbles in a liquid
during a reaction is called effervescence. In the reaction
given above, one of the reactants is a liquid. In such
cases, ie. when one of the reactants is a liquid, the gas
produced forms bubbles in the liquid, i.e. effervescence
takes place.

(ii) Change of colour : Certain chemical
reactions are characterized by a change in the colour
of the reactants.

Example

When a few pieces of iron are dropped into a blue
coloured copper sulphate solution, the blue colour of
the solution fades and eventually turns into light green
due to the formation of ferrous sulphate.

Fe + CuSO,(aq) > FeSO, + Gu
{iron} [blue solution] (green solution] [copper]
(red deposit)

(iii) Formation of precipitates : Certain
chemical reactions are characterized by the
formation of insoluble solid substances called
precipitates.

Examples

(a) When a solution of silver nitrate is added to
a solution of sodium chloride, a white
insoluble substance (precipitate), silver chloride,

is formed.
AgNO,(aqg) + NaCl(ag) — AgCl(ppt) + NaNO,(aq)
[silver nitrate [sodium [silver [sodium
solution] chloride chloride] nitrate
solution] (white ppt) solution]

(b) When ferrous sulphate solution is added to
sodium hydroxide solution, a dirty green
precipitate of ferrous hydroxide is formed.

FeSO,(aqg) + 2NaOH(aq) —> Fe(OH),1 + Na,SO,(aq)
[ferrous {sodium (ferrous [sodium
sulphate] hydroxide] hydroxide) sulphate]

(dirty green ppt)

(iv) Change of state : In many chemical
reactions, a change of state is observed. The reaction
might start with gaseous or liquid reactants and end
up with solid products, and vice versa.

Example
Ammonia gas reacts with hydrogen chloride gas to
produce solid ammonium chloride.
NH;(g) + HCi(g) =~ NH,Ci(s)

1. Direct combination or synthesis

A reaction in which two or more substances
combine together to form a single substance is called
a combination reaction.

A+B-— AB

In the above reaction, a combination of
substances A and B takes place to give a molecule
of a new substance, AB.

In combination reactions:
(i) two elements combine to form a compound
[this reaction is also called synthesis].

¢ Carbon burns in oxygen to form a gaseous
compound, carbon dioxide.

c + 0, M4, co, +Heat

[carbon] [oxygen] [carbon dioxide]

e When magnesium is burnt, it combines
directly with the oxygen of air to form
magnesium oxide.

2Mg + O, > 2MgO
(ii) an element and a compound combine to give a
new compound.

Example : Carbon monoxide, a compound, burns
in the presence of oxygen, an element, to form a
single product, carbon dioxide.

2CO (g) + O,(g) + 2c0, @)
[carbon [oxygen] [carbon
monoxide] dioxide]

¢ Sulphur dioxide and oxygen combines under
certain conditions to form sulphur trioxide.

280, + O > 280;
(iii) two or more compounds combine to forma single
product.
Example : Ammonia and hydrogen chloride,
both compounds, combine to form a new
compound, ammonium chloride.

(ii) Hold a piece of magnesium ribbon over a
flame. It burns with a dazzling light, forming
magnesium oxide.

2Mg + O, > 2MgO (synthesis)

2. Decomposition

It is the breaking up of a compound either into
elements or simpler compounds, such that these
products do not recombine to form the original
compound.

Decomposition may occur in the presence of
heat or light, or by the passage of an electric current.

A decomposition reaction that is brought about
by heat is known as thermal decomposition.

In a decomposition reaction :
(i) acompound breaks up into two or more elements.
Examples :

(a) The compound mercuric oxide, when heated,
decomposes to form two elements, mercury and

oxygen.
2Hg0 (s) —» 2Hg@) + 0, (8)

Note : The symbol A (delta) is used to signify
that heat has caused the reaction.

(b) When electric current is passed through
acidulated water, the latter decomposes into

hydrogen and oxygen.

(ii) a compound can break up to form both elements

of a decomposition reaction.

Put some zinc carbonate in a test tube fitted with

When hydrated copper(II) sulphate is heated in
a test tube, the blue-coloured crystals change
into white anhydrous salt. The change may be
represented by the following equation :

CuSO, - 5H,O(s) + CuSO,(s) + 5H,O(g)

hydrated salt anhydrous salt
(blue) (colourless)

However, anhydrous copper(II) sulphate may be
changed to the blue hydrated form by taking a
sample of the anhydrous salt and adding water
to it (this is the test to detect the presence of
water).

CuSO,(s) + SH,O() > CuSO,-5H,0(g)

anhydrous salt hydrated salt
(colourless) (blue)

So far, most of the reactions that we have
considered proceed quite definitely in a certain
direction, and it is possible to identify the
reactants and the products. However, there also
exists a group of reactions in which the direction
of chemical change can be reversed by changing
the conditions under which the reaction is taking
place. Such reactions are called reversible
reactions.

Thus, this is a reversible reaction, and the
equation for the reaction is :

CuSO,-5H,O(s) === CuSO,(s) + 5H,O(g)

To show that the reaction is reversible, we put
the sign “==” in between the reactants and
the products.

If steam is passed over red hot iron, the latter is

partially converted into magnetic oxide, and
hydrogen is released. If, on the other hand,

hyurogen 1s passed’over the heated oxide, it
partially changes back to steam.

3Fe + 4H,0 =— Fe,0, + 4H,
In either case, the reaction ends with a mixture
of reactants and products.

Experiments : To show thermal dissociation

(v)

Heat some solid ammonium chloride in a test
tube. Two colourless gases ammonia and
hydrogen chloride are produced. As these gases
move up at the upper part of the test tube whic is
cooler, they combine to form ammonium chloride,
which appears as a white sublimate on the cooler
upper side of the test tube.
NH,Cl === NH, T + HCI T

A simultaneous reversible decomposition
reaction brought about only by heat is thermal
dissociation.

Take a solution of copper sulphate in a beaker,
add a few pieces of zinc, and stir with a glass
rod. The blue colour of the solution gradually
fades, and soon the solution becomes colourless.
At the same time, reddish brown particles of
copper settle down in the beaker.

CuSO, + Zn > ZnSO, + Cul

In a test tube, take some dilute sulphuric acid
and drop a small piece of magnesium ribbon.
Brisk effervescence takes place, and hydrogen
is evolved, which burns with a pop sound on
bringing a burning match stick near the mouth
of the test tube.
Mg + H,SO, — MgSO, + H,
Pass chlorine gas through a solution of
potassium iodide. The colourless solution turns
yellow brown as iodine appears.
2KI + Cl, — 2KCI + I,


--- Page 7 ---
From the above examples, 1t can be noticed that
in metal, zinc is more active (reactive) than copper,
and magnesium is more active compared to hydrogen.
In non-metals chlorine is more active as compared to
iodine.

By taking similar examples, the following
activity series can be prepared.

4. Double decomposition

This is a type of chemical change in which two
compounds in a solution react to form two new
compounds by mutual exchange of radicals. Double
decomposition reaction is also called double
displacement reaction.

AB + CD — AD + CB

These reactions are of two types: (a) precipitation
reactions and (b) neutralization reactions.

(a) Precipitation reaction : A chemical reaction
in which two compounds in their aqueous state react
to form an insoluble salt (a precipitate) as one of
the products is known as a precipitation reaction.

For example :
BaCl, (aq) + Na,SO, (aq) > BaSO,(s) + NaCl (aq)
white ppt.
CuSO, (aq) + H2S (g) > CuS(s) + H,SO, (aq)
black ppt

Experiments : To show double decomposition

reactions.

(i) Take a solution of silver nitrate in a test tube
and add dilute hydrochloric acid or a solution

ot sodium chloride. A white, curdy precipitate
is formed.

AgNO, + HCI — AgCl J + HNO,
AgNO, + NaCl > AgCl J + NaNO,
(ii) Fill one-third of a test tube with a solution of
dilute sulphuric acid, and add to it a solution of

barium chloride. A thick white precipitate is
immediately formed.

BaCl, + H,SO, > BaSO, J + 2HCI

(b) Neutralization: The reaction between an
acid and a base that forms salt and water only is
referred to as reaction of neutralisation.

The reaction takes place because the hydrogen
ion(H*) from the acid combines with the hydroxyl
ion(OH-) from the base, to form water.

NaOH + HCl > NaCl + H,O
OR
Nat OH- + H* Cl- > Nat Cl + H* OH-
Ionic form

Cancelling the common ions, Nat and
Cl-, the only change is the combination of H+ and
OH- ions to form un-ionized water,

ie. H*++OH- > H,0

Note : Double decomposition reactions may also
occur with evolution of gas.

Example :

FeS(s) + H,SO, (aq) > FeSO, + H,ST

As a chemical process, neutralization has
many uses

(a) When someone is stung by a bee, formic acid
enters the skin and gives pain, which can be
relieved by rubbing the spot with slaked lime or
baking soda, both of which are bases.

(b) If our stomach glands secrete excess HCl, we
experience pain, which is relieved by taking
milk of magnesia or sodium hydrogen
carbonate, both of which are bases. On the other
hand, if there is a deficiency of HCl, some or
the other suitable acid is taken in dilute form to
make up for it.

Hydrolysis : It is the process in which a
salt and water react to form an acidic or a basic
solution.

In the process of hydrolysis, only those salts hydrolyse
that are formed by the reaction of (i) strong base

and weak acid and (ii) strong acid and weak base.

This happens because a salt formed due to
a strong base and a weak acid, on dissolving in water,
will make a basic solution. A basic solution turns red
litmus blue.

a weak base, on dissolving in water, will make an
acidic solution. Acidic solutions turn blue litmus red.

Note : Strong acids and strong bases ionize to a
large extent in aqueous solution. Weak acids
and weak bases ionize to only a small extent in
aqueous solution, and the salts formed by them
usually do not hydrolyse.

2.4 ENERGY CHANGE
REACTIONS

In every chemical change or chemical reaction,
change in energy is involved, i.e. there is a difference
between the chemical energies of the reactants and
the products. This energy can be in the form of heat,
light, sound and electricity.

IN CHEMICAL

Every substance has a fixed amount of stored
energy, which is in the form of potential energy,

and is referred to as its chemical energy.

A chemical reaction involves the breaking up of
chemical bonds between atoms resulting in absorption
of energy in the form of heat, and simultaneous
formation of bonds with release of energy. These two
types of energy are different from each other, i.e. there
is either a surplus or a deficit of energy during the
reaction. Therefore, in a chemical reaction, energy is
either absorbed or released. .

Depending upon the energy released or
absorbed, chemical changes or chemical reactions are
of two types :

1. Exothermic
2. Endothermic

1. Exothermic reaction : A chemical reaction in
which heat (a form of energy) is given out is
called exothermic reaction. It causes a rise in
temperature.

Examples :
(a) When carbon burns in oxygen to form carbon
dioxide, a lot of heat is produced.

C + O, > CO, + Heat
[carbon] [oxygen] [carbon dioxide]

(b) When water is added to quicklime, a lot of heat
energy is produced [along with alkaline calcium
hydroxide (slaked lime)].

CaO + H,O — Ca(OH), + Heat
[quicklime] (slaked lime]

(c) Formation of water : When hydrogen is burnt

in oxygen, water is formed and heat is released.

2H, +0, —S> 2H,0 + Heat

(d) Formation of ammonia : Nitrogen reacts with
hydrogen in the presence of catalyst (finely
divided) iron at 450°C to 500°C, and above

200 atmospheres of pressure to form ammonia.

N, + 3H, —4-» 2NH; + Heat

Note : The sign A indicates heat.

Respiration, rusting, and burning of coal, petrol,
kerosene, etc., are some common exothermic
reactions.

2. Endothermic reaction : A chemical reaction in
which heat is absorbed is called endothermic
reaction. It causes a fall in temperature.

This reaction cannot be sustained without supply
of energy from an external source.

Examples :

(a) Formation of carbon disulphide : When carbon
is heated with sulphur at high temperature, liquid
carbon disulphide is formed.

C+28+—4> cs,

(b) When nitrogen and oxygen are heated together
to a temperature of about 3000°C, nitric oxide
gas is formed. This is an endothermic reaction.

endothermic reaction.

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE

Whenever energy is applied to matter, changes occurs. Changes are mainly of two types : physical and
chemical.

A change in which only the physical properties of a substance get changed, not its chemical
composition, is called a physical change, viz. breaking of glass.

A physical change is a temporary change and is reversible in nature.

During a physical change, only the physical properties, such as state, colour, shape, etc. undergo a change.

A change in which chemical composition and chemical properties of reacting substances undergo a
change is called a chemical change, viz. burning of paper.

A chemical change is a permanent change, i.e. it is irreversible.

Changes occur by (i) mixing the substances in solution state (ii) by heat (iii) light (iv) electricity
(v) pressure (vi) in the presence of a catalyst.

A chemical reaction is the process of breaking the chemical bonds of reactants and formation of new
bonds to form new products.

Chemical reaction is confirmed by (i) evolution of gas (ii) change of colour (iii) formation of
precipitate (iv) change of state.

A reaction in which two or more substances combine to form a new substance is called a combination
reaction : Fe + S — FeS.

A reaction in which a substance is broken down into two or more substances is called a decomposition
reaction : 2HgO — 2Hg + O,.

A reaction in which one part of a molecule is replaced by another is called a displacement reaction :
CuSO, + Fe — FeSO, + Cu.

A reaction in which two reacting molecules exchange their corresponding ions, is called a double
displacement reaction : NaCl + AgNO, — AgCl + NaNO,.

A reaction in which one of the products formed is an insoluble substance that is thrown out of the
solution as solid (precipitate) is called precipitation reaction : Na,SO, + BaCl, > BaSO, + 2NaCl.

A reaction in which heat is liberated (or given out) is called an exothermic reaction.

A reaction in which heat is absorbed is called an endothermic reaction.
