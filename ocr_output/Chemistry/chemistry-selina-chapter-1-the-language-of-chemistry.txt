1.1 INTRODUCTION

Chemistry is a branch of science in which we
study about matter, i.e. what is matter made up of,
what is its nature, structure and what changes are
observed when it is subjected to different conditions.

Many theories were proposed regarding matter
which helped us to discover the real essence of matter,
i.e, matter is nothing but a complex relationship between
elements. An element is a simple and pure form of matter
which cannot be decomposed into simpler substances.
All elements are made of atoms, the smallest particles of
an element which represent all the properties of an
element. A set of atoms of the same type together form
the molecule of the element. Molecules can be
monoatomic, diatomic and even polyatomic.

Monoatomic molecules — elements having only one atom
in their molecules, e.g. helium, neon and other inert gas
molecules.

Diatomic molecules — elements having two atoms in their
molecules, e.g. hydrogen (H,), Oxygen (03),
Nitrogen (N3).

Tetratomic molecules — elements having four atoms in
their molecules, e.g. phosphorus (P,).

Octatomic molecules — elements having eight atoms in
their molecules, e.g. sulphur (Sg).

Thus, we can say that a molecule is the smallest
particle that has capability to exist independently. The
molecule of an element exhibits all the properties of that
element.

When atoms or molecules of different elements
combine, they form the molecule of a compound. To name
a few, sodium chloride (NaCl), water (HO), ammonia
(NH) are molecules of compounds.

The names of elements and compounds are
abreviated by using certain symbols and formulae.

Before 1600 A.D., alchemists tried to represent
the substances that they used for their experiments by
different kinds of pictographic symbols, such as a
triangle for the earth, a crescent for silver, etc. Dalton
used some other types of symbols to represent
elements, such as a circle [OD] for an oxygen atom, a
circle with a dot in its centre [©] for hydrogen, etc.

Later, Johann Berzelius suggested that the initial
letter of an element written in capitals should represent
that particular element, such as O for oxygen, H for
hydrogen, C for carbon, and so on. But in some cases,
the suggested symbol did not agree with the English
name of the element. This was because some of the
symbols were based on the Latin names of the
elements, as shown in Table 1.1.

However, the method suggested by him laid the
basis of the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry) system of chemical symbols and
formulae.

1.2 CHEMICAL SYMBOLS

A symbol is the short form that stands for the
atom of a specific element or the abbreviations used
for the names of elements.

Each element is denoted by a symbol,
which is usually the first letter of its name in English
or Latin, written in capital.

Example : Sulphur, an element, is denoted by
the symbol ‘S’. Similarly, hydrogen is denoted by
the symbol ‘H’.

However, when the first letter of more than one
element is the same, the elements are denoted by
two letters. The first letter is written in capital, while
the second one is written in small.

Example : Carbon, cobalt, copper, calcium,
cadmium, chromium, and chlorine are elements
whose first letter is C. Therefore, only carbon is
denoted by the symbol ‘C’. Cobalt is denoted by two
letters ‘Co’. Copper is denoted by the two letters
‘Cu’ {taken from its Latin name cuprum]. Calcium
by Ca, Cadmium by Cd, Chromium by Cr and
Chlorine by Cl.

A symbol is not merely an abreviation for the
name of an element but also has significance.

(ii) One atom of the element
(iii) Quantity of the element equal in mass to
its atomic mass or gram atomic mass.
For example, the symbol N stands for
(i) The element Nitrogen
(ii) One atom of Nitrogen
(iii) 14 parts by weight of Nitrogen. This weight
being the atomc weight of the element.
Note : Be careful about capital and small alphabets.

For example : Co means the element cobalt.
CO means the compound carbon monoxide.

1.3 FORMULA

Atoms of elements combine to form molecules.
So it is possible to represent the molecules in terms of
symbols of the constituent atoms. The symbolic
representation of a molecule is known as formula or
molecular formula.

A molecular formula also known as chemical
formula employs symbols to denote the molecule of an
element or of a compound.

A molecule of an element may contain one or
more atoms of it. For example a molecule of elements
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, bromine,
iodine, contains two atoms and are written as H),
O,, N», Cl, Bry and I, respectively.

In case of a compound, the molecule containing


--- Page 3 ---
different atoms united in certain fixed ratio, is
represented by placing symbols of the elements
present in it side by side indicating their numbers
written in subscript. Thus, NH,CI represents one
molecule of ammonium chloride containing one atom
of nitrogen four atoms of hydrogen and one atom of
chlorine.

Na,CO, denotes one molecule of sodium
carbonate which contains two atoms of sodium, one
atom of carbon and three atoms of oxygen.

2H,O represents two molecules of water i.e.
dihydrogen oxide, each molecule containing two
atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.

Thus by looking at a formula, we understand
the ratio in which the different atoms are united to
form the molecule.

Significance of molecular formula
The molecular formula of a compound has
quantitative significance. It represents :
(i) both the molecule and the molecular mass of the
compound.
{ii) the respective numbers of different atoms present in
one molecule of the compound.
(iii) the ratios of the respective masses of the elements
present in the compound.
For example, the formula CO) means that:
(i) the molecular formula of carbon dioxide is CO,;
(ii) each molecule contains one carbon atom joined by
chemical bonds with two oxygen atoms;
(iii) the molecular mass of carbon dioxide is 44, given that
the atomic mass of carbon is 12 and that of oxygen
is 16.

1.4 VALENCY

Valency is the combining capacity of an atom

or of a radical.

Valency is measured in terms of hydrogen atoms
or oxygen atoms. It is the number of hydrogen atoms
or double the number of oxygen atoms that can
combine with it.

Since no other element has combining capacity
less than that of hydrogen, its valency is taken to be
one (1) and is considered a standard.

Modern Definition of Valency

The number of electrons, that atom can lose, gain
or share during a chemical reaction is called its

ERY EA ah NRC OF» CUO nN ly Ah IO REN AEG ROR ATR

valency. (For details refer to chapter Atomic
Structure).

Elements with one, two or three electrons in
their outermost shell (valence shell) are usually
metals. Electrons in the outermost shell are known
as valence electrons. To attain stable electronic
configuration, these atoms lose their valence
electrons and form positive ions*.

Na - e& — Nat (univalent)
2, 8, 1 2,8
Mg - 2e- > Mg?+ (divalent)
2, 8,2 2,8

Al -— 3e > A+ (trivalent)
2, 8,3 2, 8

Positive ions are known as cations.

Elements with five, six or seven electrons in their
outermost shell are normally non-metals. To attain
stability, these atoms have to have eight electrons in
their outermost orbit; so they gain electrons.

Note : Out of the elements that have four electrons
in the outermost orbit — Carbon is a non-metal, Silicon
and Germanium are metalloid and rest are metals.

Cl + e ~ Clr (univaient)
(2, 8, 7) 2, 8,8

O + 2e° > O2- (divalent)

(2, 6) 2,8

N + 3e- > N3- (trivalent)

(2, 5) 2, 8

Negative ions are known as anions.

in outermost shel eaten PP [PLP
in outermost sheil

The valency of an element or of a radical is the
number of hydrogen atoms that will combine with
or displace one atom of that element or radical.

| Valency |

Examples of sharing of atoms :
(i) One atom of chlorine combines with
one hydrogen atom to form a molecule of
hydrogen chloride. So, the valency of chlorine

is one.
H-Cl

* Ions are charged particles which are formed by loss or gain of
electrons


--- Page 4 ---
(ii) One atom of oxygen combines with 2 atoms of
hydrogen to form a molecule of water. So, the
valency of oxygen is two.

a7 Nu

(iii) In an ammonia molecule, one atom of
nitrogen combines with 3 atoms of hydrogen.
So, the valency of nitrogen is three.

VAN

(iv) In a methane molecule, one carbon atom
combines with 4 hydrogen atoms. So, the
valency of carbon is four.

Variable valency

Certain elements exhibit more than one valency,
i.e. they show variable valency.

Reasons for variable valency

An atom of an element can sometimes lose
more electrons than are present in its valence
shell, i.e. there is a loss of electrons from
the penultimate shell too. Therefore, such an element
is said to exhibit variable valency.

If an element exhibits two different positive
valencies, then we use the suffix “ous” for the lower
valency and the suffix “ic” for the higher valency.
Modern chemists use Roman numerals in place of
these trivial names. For example, SnCly, i.e.
stannous chloride is written as Tin (II) chloride,
SnCl,, i.e. stannic chloride is written as Tin (IV)
chloride.

Non-metals like nitrogen, phosphorus and
sulphur also show variable valency. Nitrogen and
phosphorus exhibit valencies of 3 and 5 while
sulphur exhibits valencies of 2, 4 and 6.

1.5 RADICALS

The molecule of a compound is usually made up
of two parts, these parts separately are known as
radicals. For example, molecule of potassium chloride
has two parts, potassium and chloride, so potassium
is one radical and chloride is the other radical;
similarly magnesium sulphate has magnesium and
sulphate as radicals.

A radical is an atom or a group of atoms of

the same or of different elements that behaves as
a single unit with a positive or negative charge.

A radical is called simple radical when it is an
atom only like sodium (Nat) and magnesium (Mg?*).
It is known as a compound radical when it is made
up of a group of two or more different atoms
(polyatomic) like sulphate (SO,2-) made up of one
sulphur atom and four oxygen atoms.

Note : An acid reacts with a base to produce
salt and water as a result of neutralisation.

Potassium + Hydrochloric — Potassium + Water

hydroxide acid chloride
(Base) (Acid) (Salt)

In the formation of potassium chloride, the potassium
radical has been contributed by the base potassium
hydroxide and is therefore called basic radical, the
chloride radical has been contributed by hydrochloric
acid and is, therefore, termed an acid radical.

When a salt is dissolved in water, it splits up
into constituent radicals, the basic radicals are found
to carry positive charge and so are termed electro-
positive radicals or cations. The other part carries
negative charge and so are called electronegative
radicals or anions.

‘Thus, in potassium chloride, potassium is electropositive and chloride is electronegative radical. Similarly,

in magnesium sulphate, magnesium is electropositive and sulphate is electronegative radical.

Radicals have their own combining power
(valency), and it is according to this combining power
that they form chemical formulae.

For example, in the compound ammonium
carbonate (NH,),CO; ammonium (NH,"*) is a basic
radical with combining power 1 and carbonate
(CO,2-) is an acidic radical with combining power 2.

16 WRITING CHEMICAL FORMULAE

The following steps should be taken while
attempting to write a formula. The method is called
criss-cross method.

(i) Write the symbols side by side, basic radical is
written first and then acidic radical.

(ii) Write the valency of each atom on top of its
symbol.

(iii) Divide the valency numbers by their highest
common factor (H.C.F.), if any, to get the
simple ratio. Ignore the (+) or (-) symbols of
the radicals. Interchange the valencies of the

radicals.

(iv) Write the interchanged valency numbers to
the lower right of the radicals. If the radical is a
group of atoms and has a valency number more
than 1, enclose it within brackets.

Based on the steps, mentioned alongside
formulae can be written in the following way.

1.7 NAMING CERTAIN COMPOUNDS
1. A metal and a non-metal : The metal is written
first and then the non-metal, the suffix ide is
added to thé non-metal.
For example :
Calcium + Nitrogen — Calcium nitride [Ca,N,]

For example, PCl, is phosphorus trichloride
and PCl, is phosphorus pentachloride.

3. Two elements and oxygen : Oxygen is
represented at the end of the formula.
The name of the compound depends on the
number of oxygen atoms present in the

2. Two non-metals : The prefix tri or tetra or compound.

penta, etc. is added, as the case may be.

ene ae nn eee ne nena innenanannehnentinnecrennecreeceatannecnactlf i FF) nT



--- Page 8 ---
The prefix ‘hypo’ is used if the number of oxygen
atoms is less than 2.
NaClO — Sodium hypochlorite
The suffix ‘ite’ is used if the number of oxygen atoms
is 2.
NaClO, — Sodium chlorite
The suffix ‘ate’ is used if the number of oxygen
atoms is 3.
NaClQO, — Sodium chlorate
The prefix per is used when the number of oxygen
atoms is more than 3.
NaClO, — Sodium perchlorate
4. Naming of acids
(a) Names of binary acids are given by adding the
prefix ‘hydro’ and the suffix ‘ic’ to the name of
the second element.
(i) HCl is hydrochloric acid
(ii) HF is hydrofluoric acid
(b) Names of acids containing radicals of polyatomic
groups are given on the basis of the second

element present in the molecule, and the prefix
‘hydro’ is not used.

Examples :

Examples: (i) In H,SQ,, the second element is
sulphur, hence the name sulphuric
acid.

(ii) In HNO,, the second element is
nitrogen, hence the name nitric
acid.

(iii) In H,PO,, the second element is
phosphorus, hence the name
phosphoric acid.

If the number of oxygen atoms is less, then suffix
‘ous’ is used instead of ‘ic’. Thus H,SO, is
sulphurous acid, HNO, is nitrous acid.

5. Trivial names

There are certain compounds with names that
do not follow any systematic rule. Such names are
called trivial or common names, and they are widely
accepted.

Examples: (i) Nitrogen trihydride is called

ammonia [NH]

(ii) Hydrogen monoxide or dihydrogen
oxide is called water [H,O].

1.8 TOCALCULATE THE VALENCY FROM THE

FORMULA

The valency of elements can be determined based
on the knowledge of the valencies of negative radicals
and of the fact that the valency of :

Hydrogen [H]=1;

Oxygen [O] = 2;

[Cl] = 1

Chlorine

Procedure to find the valency
1. Write the given formula.

2. Interchange the subscript and write
it as superscript.

3. The valency of oxygen is taken as 2,
therefore, multiply both the superscripts
by 2.

4. The result gives the valency of the
elements.

Thus, from the formula NO), we find that the valency of
| nitrogen is 4.

reactant side and the product side.

(iv) Represent the reactants and the products in their
molecular forms [because their atomic forms are
usually neither stable nor capable of separate
existence].

For example :

Sodium reacts with water to form sodium
hydroxide and hydrogen.

2Na + 2H,O — 2NaOH + H,

A chemical equation tells us what substances are
involved in a given reaction (REACTANTS) and
what are the substances formed as a result of the
reaction (PRODUCTS).

For example :

CuSO, + 2NaOH > Cu(OH), + Na,SO,
Ld Ls

Reactants Products
In the given equation copper sulphate and
sodium hydroxide (REACTANTS) react to produce
copper hydroxide and sodium sulphate (PRODUCTS).

Chemical reactions may involve :
(i) one reactant and two or more products
(ii) two reactants and one product
(iii) two reactants and two products
(iv) two reactants and three or more products

(i) one reactant and two or more products

Examples :
(b) 2Pb(NO3), > 2PbO + 4NO, +0,

(ii) two reactants and one product

Examples :
(a) NH, + HCl — NH,Cl
(b) N,+3H, — 2NH;

(iii) two reactants and two products

Examples :
(a) AgNO,;+NaCl — AgCl + NaNO,
(b) Na,SO, + BaCl, > BaSO, + 2NaCl

_(iv) two reactants and three or more products
Examples :

(a) Cu + 2H,SO, — CuSO, + 2H,O + SO,

(b) 2KMnO, + 16HCI > 2KCI + 2MnCl, + 8H,O + SCI,

Skeleton equation : It is an equation that
represents a chemical change but is unbalanced. In

other words, the total number of atoms of each element
on the two sides are not equal. The following example
will make the point clear.

KNO, — KNO, + 0,

In the above chemical equation, the number of
oxygen atoms in the reactant (KNO3), on the left
side, is not equal to the number of oxygen atoms in
the products formed (KNO, + O,), on the right side.

1.9.1 Balanced equation

It is an equation in which the total number of atoms
of each element in the reactants, on the left side of the
equation, is the same as the number of atoms in the
products formed, on the right side of the equation.

Examples :
(a) CaCO, — CaO + CO,

In this equation, the number of atoms of Ca, C
and O on both sides is the same, i.e. the equation
is balanced.

(b) KNO,; > KNO, + 0,
In this equation, since the number of atoms
of oxygen on both sides is not the same, the
equation is not balanced. The balanced form of

the equation is :
2KNO; — 2KNO, + O,

Why should an equation be balanced ?

An equation must be balanced in order to
comply with the “Law of Conservation of Matter’,
which states that matter is neither created nor destroyed

in the course of a chemical reaction. An unbalanced
equation would imply that atoms have been created or
destroyed.

1.9.2 How to balance a chemical equation
There are two methods of balancing an equation:
(i) Hit and trial method
(ii) Partial equation method
1. Balancing by hit and trial method
This method consists of counting the number of
atoms of each element on both sides and trying to
equalize them. Take the following steps :
(i) Count the number of times (frequency) an
element occurs on either side.
(ii) The element with the least frequency of
occurrence is balanced first.


--- Page 11 ---
(iii) When two or more elements have the same
frequency, the metallic element is balanced first.
Example 1 : Balance the following equation
Cu +H,SO, > CuSO, + SO, + H,O0
Solution :

Step 1: Count the number of atoms of all the
elements on either side of the chemical equation.

Element Reactant side Product side
Cu 1 I
H 2 2
S | 2
O 4 7

Step 2: Copper and hydrogen are equal on both
sides so to equalise sulphur atoms multiply H,SO,
by 2.

Cu + 2H,SO, > CuSO, + SO, + H,O

Step 3: To equalise hydrogen atoms, multiply

This gives the balanced equation.

Example 2 : Balance the following skeleton
equation.

As7O3 + SnCl, + HCl > SnCl, + As + H,O
Solution :

Step 1: Count the number of atoms of all the
elements on both sides of the equation.

Element _ Reactant side Product side
As 2 1
Sn 1 1
Cl 3 2
H 1 2
O 3 1

Step 2: To equalise As and O, multiply As by 2
and H,O by 3.
As,03 + SnCl, + HCl > SnCl, + 2As + 3H,0
Step 3: To equalise H atoms multiply HCI by 6.
As,0; + SnCl, + 6HCI - SnCl, + 2As + 3H,0
Step 4: Multiply SnCl, and SnCl, both by 3.
As,03 + 3SnCl, + 6HCl > 3SnCl, + 2As + 3H,0
This is te balanced chemical equation.

Example 3 : Balance the following skeletal equation:
Fe + H,O > Fe,0; + H,

Solution :

Step 1: Count the number of atoms of all the
elements on both sides of the chemical equation.

Element Reactant side Product side
Fe 1 atom 2 atoms
H 2 atoms 2 atoms
O 1 atom 3 atoms

Step 2: To balance Fe atoms, multiply Fe on
the LHS by 2.

2Fe + H,O0 - Fe,0; + H2
Step 3: To balance oxygen atoms on the RHS,
write 3 before H,O on the reactant side.
2Fe + 3H,0 - Fe,0; + H,
Step 4: Now there are 6 hydrogen atoms on the
reactant side and only 2 hydrogen atoms on the

product side. To balance the hydrogen atoms, write
3 before hydrogen on the product side.

2Fe + 3H,0 — Fe,0, + 3H,
The above equation is a balanced equation
Example 4 : Ammonia is prepared by heating a
mixture of ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide.
Write a balanced equation of the reaction.
Solution :
(i) NH,Cl + Ca(OH), — CaCl, + NH, + H,O
This is the skeleton equation.
(ii) To equalise Cl atoms multiply NH,Cl by 2
2NH,Cl + Ca(OH), — CaCl, + NH, + H,O
(iii) To equalise nitrogen atoms multiply NH, by 2
2NH,Cl + Ca(OH), — CaCl, + 2NH, + 2H,O
(iv) To equalise oxygen atoms multiply H,O by 2
2H,Cl + Ca(OH), > CaCl, + 2NH, + 2H,O
The above equation is a balanced equation.

Example 5 : Potassium dichromate reacts
with hydrochloric acid to produce potassium
chloride, chromium chloride, water and chlorine.

Write the skeletal equation of the reaction and
balance it.
Step 1: The skeletal equation is

Step 2: Balance oxygen, hydrogen, potassium,
chromium and chlorine, starting with oxygen because


--- Page 12 ---
it occurs at the minimum number of places.
¢ To equalize oxygen, multiply H,O by 7;
K,Cr,0, + HCl > KCl + CrCl; + 7H,0 + Cl,
¢ To equalize hydrogen, multiply HCI by 14;
K,Cr,0, + 14HCl > KCI + CrCl, + 7H, + Cl,
¢ To equalize K and Cr, multiply both KCl and
CrCl, by 2;
K,Cr,0, + 14 HCl > 2KCl + 2CrCl, + 7H,O + Cl,
* To equalize Cl, multiply it by 3, ie. 3Cl,
K,Cr,0, + 14 HCl > 2KCI + 2 CrCl, +7 H,0 +3 Cl,

Now the equation is balanced.

Note : A balanced equation need not represent
the real reaction.

For example : Cu + H,SQ,4 — CuSO, + H,
is a balanced reaction, but experiments show that copper
reacts with conc. H,SO, to give SO, and not hydrogen.
The correct chemical equation is :
Cu + 2H,SO, — CuSO, + SO, + 2H,0.

The hit and trial method is very useful for
balancing simple chemical equations, but it has some
limitations.

(i) It takes time to balance complicated equations.

(ii) The mechanism (steps of the reaction i.e. how
the reaction has taken place) of the reaction is
not clear.

Balancing can be done more easily by supposing
the complex reaction to take place in steps.

Write the equations for these individual steps
and then add the equations. This method is known
as balancing by partial equation method*.

The following examples will make it more clear.

Example 6 : Liberation of iodine from
potassium iodide by reacting it with hydrogen
peroxide is supposed to be completed in the following
two steps :

(i) H,O, decomposes to give water + nascent
oxygen
H,0, > H,0 +O see)
(11) Nascent oxygen so produced oxidizes potassium
iodide in the presence of water to give iodine
and potassium hydroxide.

* Not in syllabus

2K] +H,O0+O-—> 2KOH+1I, (ii)
Adding the two equations (i) and (ii) we get
H,0, - H,0 +O
2KI + H,O + O > 2KOH +1,

H,O and O occur on the product side, in the
first reaction, while on the reactant side in the second
reaction, so they get cancelled. The resultant equation
is a balanced chemical equation.

1.9.3 Information conveyed by a balanced
chemical equation

Refer to the following equations :
(1) 2NaOH + H,SO, — Na,SO, + 2H,O
The above equation tells us :
(a) about the actual result of the chemical change.

(b) about the reactants involved and the products
formed as a result of the reaction.

(c) about the number of molecules of each
substance taking part and formed in the reaction.
Here two molecules of sodium hydroxide and one
molecule of sulphuric acid react to give one
molecule of sodium sulphate and two molecules
of water.

(d) about the chemical composition of the
respective molecules; one molecule of sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) contains one atom of sodium,
one atom of oxygen and one atom of hydrogen.

(e) About molecular mass; that 80 parts by weight of
sodium hydroxide reacts with 98 parts by weight
of sulphuric acid to produce 142 parts by weight
of sodium sulphate and 36 parts by weight of
water.

2NaOH + H,SO, > Na,SO, + 2H,O
2(23+16+1) + (24+324+64) = (464+32+64) + 2(2+16)
=> 80 +98 = 142+ 36
=> 178 = 178

(f) It also proves the law of conservation of mass,
i.e. the total mass of the substances on either
side of the equation is the same. According to the
above equation, 178 gram of reactants are producing
178 gram of products.


--- Page 13 ---
Note : On the basis of experimentas it is found that
22.4 litres of every gas, at 760 mm pressure and
temperature of 0°C (STP), weighs the same as its
molar mass i.e. molecular mass expressed in grams.

For example : .

22.4 litres of hydrogen at S.T.P. will weigh 2 g.
22.4 litres of ammonia at S.T.P. will weigh 17 g,
and so on.

(b)

(c)

One molecule of calcium carbonate reacts
with two molecules of hydrochloric acid to
produce one molecule each of calcium
chloride, water and carbon dioxide.

100 g of calcium carbonate reacts with 73 g
of hydrochloric acid to produce 111g of
calcium chloride, 18 g of water and 44 g of
carbon dioxide.

(Note that the masses of the reactants and the
products are taken in grams)

100 g of calcium carbonate, on treatment with
73 g of HCl, will produce 22.4 litres of
carbon dioxide at S.T-P.

1.10 RELATIVE
WEIGHT)

Atoms being extremely small, cannot be seen
or weighed directly. But indirect methods of physics
have enabled us to know the absolute mass of nearly
all kinds of atoms. The mass of a hydrogen atom is
found to be 1-66 x 10-24 g while that of carbon
atom is 1-9926 x 10°23 g. As these masses are too
small, it is not convenient to use kilograms or grams
as unit. It has, therefore, been considered appropriate
to use the mass of some standard atom as a unit and
then relate masses of other atoms to it. The resulting
masses of atoms are thus known as Relative Atomic
Mass (RAM) or Atomic Weight.

In the beginning, the mass of the hydrogen
atom (hydrogen element being the lightest) was
chosen as a unit and masses of other atoms were
compared with it. In 1961, carbon-12 was finally
selected, because its adoption least affected the
values of the atomic mass of the various elements
on the old standard.

ATOMIC MASS (ATOMIC

The relative atomic mass or atomic weight of an
element is the number of times one atom of the element

is heavier than 4 times of the mass of an atom of

carbon-12. Thus:
Relative atomic mass = Mass of 1 atomof the element

Chil the mass of one C- 12 atom

Atomic mass is expressed in atomic mass units
{a.m.u.]. Atomic mass unit is defined as 1/12 the
mass of carbon atom C-12. (The mass of an atom
of carbon—12 isotope was given the atomic mass of
12 units, ie. 12 amu or simply 12 u).

Thus, the mass of a hydrogen atom is 1 amu,
and those of oxygen and helium are 16 amu and

4 amu respectively (Atomic masses of elements are
given in the preliminary pages of this book).

Note : Experimentally it is found that one atom
of C!2 (carbon having atomic mass 12) atom has a
mass of 1-9926 x 10-23 grams. On dividing this mass
by 12, atomic mass unit (amu or U) is obtained. It is
equal to 1-6605 x 10-24 gram. Thus,

1 amu or 1 U = 1-6605 x 10-4 g

111 RELATIVE MOLECULAR
(MOLECULAR WEIGHT)

MASS

The relative molecular mass (or molecular weight)
of an element or a compound is the number that

represents how many times one molecule of the
substance is heavier than 1/12 of the mass of an
atom of carbon-12.

The Relative Molecular Mass (RMM) is
obtained by adding together the relative atomic
masses (atomic weights) of all the various atoms
present in a molecule.

For example, relative molecular mass of
sulphuric acid (H,SO,) is calculated as:

One molecule of sulphuric acid has two atoms
of hydrogen, one atom of sulphur and four atoms of
oxygen.

Mass of 2 atoms of hydrogen is 1 x 2 = 2 amu

Mass of | atom of sulphur is 32 amu .

Mass of 4 atoms of oxygen is 16 x 4 = 64 amu

So mass of H,SO, is 2 x 1 +32 + 16 x 4=98 amu

Thus the molecular mass of a substance is the
sum of the atomic masses of the constituent atoms
present in one molecule of that substance.

masses (or molecular weights) of the following
compounds:

1.13 EMPIRICAL FORMULA OF A COMPOUND

The empirical formula of a compound is
the simplest formula, which gives the simplest ratio
in whole numbers of atoms of different elements
present in one molecule of the compound.

For example, the empirical formula of hydrogen
peroxide (HO) is HO. It indicates the simplest ratio
(1 : 1) between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in
its molecule whereas its actual formula is H,Op.

Similarly, the empirical formula of glucose
(CgH,20,) is CH,O. It indicates that the ratio of C,
H and O atoms in a molecule of glucose is 1: 2: 1.

The empirical formula mass is the sum of
atomic masses of various elements present in the
empirical formula.

Thus, for hydrogen peroxide (H,QO,), the
empirical formula is HO and its empirical formula
mass is 1 + 16 = 17.

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE

Symbol is the short form that stands for the atom of a specific element.

Valency is the combining capacity of an atom or a radical. It is equal to the number of electron(s)
lost/gained or shared while combining with another atom or radical. Some elements, like iron, mercury,

lead, show variable valencies.

Radical is an atom or a group of atoms of the same or different elements, that behave as a single: unit
‘and has positive or negative charge. A radical with positive charge is a cation, e.g. NH,* (ammonium ion),
Nat (sodium ion) and a radical with negative charge is an anion, e.g. Cl” (chloride), co, (carbonate).

Molecular formula is a shorthand notation for the molecule of a substance in terms of symbols and

numbers of atoms of each element present in it.

Atomic mass unit (amu) is equal to one twelfth the mass of an atom of carbon-12 (atomic mass of

carbon taken as 12).

Molecular mass or relative molecular mass of a substance is the relative mass of its molecule as
compared with the mass of a carbon —12 atom, taken as 12 units.

Chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction using symbols and formulae
of the substances involved in the reaction. Since matter is neither created nor destroyed in the course
of a chemical reaction, so every equation needs to be balanced.

Balanced chemical equation tells us (i) which substances take part is a chemical reaction (reactants)
and which substances are formed (products) and (ii) the number of molecules of each substance

involved.

The relative atomic mass or atomic weight of an element is the number of times one atom of the

element is heavier than 4 times of the mass of an atom of carbon-12.

The relative molecular mass (or molecular weight) of an element or a compound is the number that
represents how many times one molecule of the substance is heavier than 1/12 of the mass of an atom
of carbon-12.

The empirical formula of a compound is the simplest formula, which gives the simplest ratio in whole
‘numbers of atoms of different elements present in one molecule of the compound.
