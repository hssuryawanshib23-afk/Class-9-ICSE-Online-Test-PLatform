INTRODUCTION

It is a human instinct to classify, i.e. to put things of one kind in one group and of another kind in

another group.

Towards the end of the 18 and the beginning of the 19% centuries, more and more elements began to be
discovered, and their individual properties and compounds had begun to be studied. Soon, the need arose for
classifying them so as to make their comparative study easier.

5.1 REASONS FOR
OF ELEMENTS

1. It helps in studying the elements in an organized
manner.

CLASSIFICATION

2. It helps in correlating the properties of elements
with the fundamental properties of all states of
matter.

3. It helps in defining the relationship of one
element with another.

In the beginning, attempts were made by chemists
to classify elements on the basis of factors such as
density, malleability, ductility, etc., and also to consider
whether they were metals or non-metals. But none
of these early classifications proved satisfactory
because :

(i) the number of elements falling in a particular
group were so large that it did not serve the
purpose of generalization.

(ii) some of the characteristics being considered
varied under differing conditions.

(iii) certain elements showed metallic as well as
non-metallic characteristics.

Obviously, scientists were in search of
characteristics of an element that would never change.
It was William Prout who discovered that the atomic
mass of an element never differs and that it could
therefore, form a truly scientific basis for a
satisfactory scheme of classification.

5.2 DOBEREINER’S TRIADS

J. W. Dobereiner a German chemist observed
that certain elements displayed similar properties and
that they could be placed in groups of three elements
each. These groups of three elements each were
called triads.

The three elements of a particular triad had
similar chemical properties. In fact, Dobereiner was
the first scientist to show the clear relationship
between properties of an element and its atomic
mass.

The atomic mass of the middle element of a triad
was approximately equal to the arithmetic mean
(average) of the atomic masses of the other two
elements of that triad.



--- Page 2 ---
The following examples will make this point
clear.
(a) Take three elements, calcium, strontium and
barium. These elements have following similarities:
(i) All are metals;
(ii) Each has an oxide that is alkaline in nature;
(iii) Each has valency 2.

Since these elements have similar chemical
properties, they were put together in one group
(or family) to form a triad called Dobereiner’s triad.

The atomic mass of calcium is 40, strontium is
88 and barium is 137. It is noticed that the middle
element, strontium, has atomic mass approximately
equal to the average i.e., mean value of the atomic
masses of calcium and barium.

The mean of the atomic masses of calcium and
40+137 _ 177 _ge5

2 2
This is nearly the same as the atomic mass of

strontium (88).

barium =

(b) Take three elements chlorine (35-5), bromine
(80) and iodine (127); they also form a triad because:

(i) all are non-metals;
(ii) all react with water to form acids
(iii) all have valency 1.

The mean of the atomic masses of Cl and

the same as the atomic mass of bromine.

Reasons for discarding the law of triad

(i) Dobereiner failed to arrange all the then known
elements in the form of triads.

(ii) The law did not fully apply even within the same
family.

For example, taking halogens, viz. the first
three members, Fluorine (19), Chlorine (35-5)
and Bromine (80), it is observed that the mean
of the atomic masses of Fluorine and Bromine is
5 (19 + 80) = 49-5, not 35:5.

So, Dobereiner’s scheme of classification of
elements was not very successful, though it did
contain important insights and principles.

5.3. NEWLAND’S LAW OF OCTAVES

John Newland (a scientist and a lover of music)

arranged elements in ascending order of atomic mass

and found that every eighth element had properties
similar to the properties of the first element, just as
the eighth note of a musical octave is the same as
its first note. Based on this observation, Newland
gave his law of octaves for classification of elements.

According to Newland’s law of octaves, when
elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass, the
properties of every eighth element starting from any
element are a repetition of the properties of the
Starting element.

Newland divided the elements into horizontal
rows of seven elements each, as shown above [the
noble, i.e. inert, gases were not known at that time].

Merits of Newland’s classification
1. This system worked quite well for the lighter
elements. For example, lithium, sodium and
potassium were brought together.
2. It relates the properties of the elements to their
atomic masses.
3. For the first time, it was shown that there is
a distinct periodicity in the properties of elements.
Newland was honoured in 1887
The Royal Society presented the Davy Medal to
Newland in 1887 for his work on classification of
elements.

Reasons for discarding the law of octaves

¢ This classification did not work with heavier
elements, i.e. those lying beyond calcium. As
more and more elements were discovered, they
could not be fitted into Newland’s Octaves.

¢ Newland adjusted two elements cobalt (Co) and
nickel (Ni) in the same slot and these were placed
in the same column as fluorine, chlorine and


--- Page 3 ---
bromine which have very different properties
than these elements.

e Iron, which resembles cobalt and nickel in
properties, has been placed far away from these
elements.

5.4 MENDELEEV’S PERIODIC TABLE

In 1869, Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a
Russian chemist, arranged all the 63 elements
known at that time in increasing order of their
atomic mass. Elements with similar properties were
put one after the other in the same vertical column
(group), with blank spaces where the expected
periodicity of the properties was disrupted, i.e.,

where the properties of an element did not tally
with the properties of the element placed above it.
He observed that elements with similar properties
occurred at regular intervals. This he called as
periodicity of properties of elements.

Based on this, he propounded a law that is called
Mendeleev’s Periodic Law.

Mendeleev’s Periodic Law
Physical and chemical properties of elements
are a periodic function of their atomic masses.

Periodic table is a chart of elements prepared
in such a way that elements with similar
properties occur in the same vertical column
(or group). It is called periodic because elements
with similar properties occur at fixed intervals
(or periods); and it is called a table because
elements are arranged in tabular form.

Essential features of Mendeleev’s periodic table :

Mendeleev’s Periodic table contains vertical

columns, called ‘groups’ and horizontal rows called
‘periods’.
¢ There are in all eight groups, i.e. Group I to Group
VIII. Each of these groups from I to VII is divided
into two sub-groups : A and B. Group VIII has no
sub group. Inert gases were not known at that time.
All elements of a sub-group (or of Group VIII,
which has no sub-group) have similar properties
and show the same valency, which is equal to the
group number (for upto Group IV) or group number
subtracted from eight (for Groups V-VII).
In a period, elements gradually change from
metallic to a non-metallic character or metallic
character decreases as one moves from left to nght
across the horizontal row.

Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was published in a German journal in 1872. He used letter “R’ to represent
the element of that particular group. Hydride of any element of group IV is written as RH4. For example
hydride of carbon is CH4. Oxide of any element of the same group is RO, (CO,).

--- Page 4 ---
Merits of Mendeleev’s table ‘

(1) Grouping of elements. He generalized the study
of the elements then known to a study of mere
eight groups.

(2) Gaps for undiscovered elements. In order
to make sure that elements having similar
properties fell in the same vertical column or
group, Mendeleev left some gaps in his
periodic table. These gaps were left for
subsequent inclusion of elements not known at
that time. Mendeleev correctly thought that
such elements would be discovered later.

(3) Prediction of properties of undiscovered
elements. He predicted the properties of the
then unknown elements on the basis of
properties of elements lying adjacent to the
vacant slots. He actually predicted the properties
of some undiscovered elements in 1871.

For example :

(i) Eka aluminium (means one place below
aluminium in the group); its atomic mass and
chemical properties are quite similar to those
of the element gallium discovered in 1876.

(ii) Properties of eka-silicon are the properties of
germanium.

(4) Incorrect atomic mass corrected. He was able
to correct the values of atomic mass of
elements like gold and platinum by placing these
elements strictly on the basis of similarities in their
properties.

Defects in Mendeleev’s periodic table
(1) Anomalous pairs :
The following pairs of elements did not follow
Mendeleev’s principles :
(i) Argon with atomic mass 39-9 preceeds
potassium with atomic mass 39-1.
(ii) Cobalt with atomic mass 58-9 preceeds nickel
with atomic mass 58-6.

fo 73 2 -

(in) Tellumnum with atomic mass 1!2/-0 preceeds
iodine with atomic mass 126-9.

(2) Position of isotopes :

Isotopes of an element are atoms of that element
having similar chemical properties but different
atomic masses.

According to Mendeleev’s periodic law, isotopes
of an element must be given separate places in the
periodic table since they have different atomic
masses. But they were not assigned separate places.

(3) Grouping of chemically dissimilar elements:
Elements such as copper and silver bear no
resemblance to alkali metals (lithium, sodium, etc.)
but they have been placed together in the first
group.
(4) Separation of chemically similar elements :
Elements that are chemically similar, such as
gold and platinum have been placed in separate
groups.

(5) Electron arrangement :

It does not explain the electron arrangement of
elements.

(6) Position of hydrogen :

Hydrogen was not given a fixed position. It was
considered in Group IA as well as in Group VIIA
because it forms both a positive ion, viz. in HCl, and
a negative ion, viz. in NaH.

5.55 ATOMIC NUMBER AS BASIS FOR MODERN
PERIODIC LAW

The magnitude of positive charge present in the
nucleus of an atom was determined by Henry
Moseley, an English physicist.

In 1913. Moseley used anodes of different metals
in a discharge tube and subjected them to attack by
cathode rays. He found, that when cathode rays struck
anodes of different metals, the wavelength of the rays
produced change. The wavelength of these rays was
found to decrease in a regular manner on changing
the metal of the anode in order of their position in
the periodic table. By this, he concluded that the
number of positive charge present in the nucleus of
an atom is the most fundamental property of an atom.



--- Page 5 ---
The number of unit positive charge present in
the nucleus of an atom of a particular element is
called the atomic number of that element.

Some of the positive charge present in the
nucleus is due to protons, the number of protons is
equal to the atomic number of that element.

Thus, Henry Moseley found that atomic
number is a better fundamental property of elements
compared to atomic mass. This led to the modern
periodic law.

Modern periodic law : Physical and chemical

properties of elements are a periodic function of
their atomic numbers.

If elements are arranged in order of their
increasing atomic number, those with similar
properties are repeated after regular intervals,
i.e. periodicity in the periodic table occurs based on
the atomic numbers (number of protons)

Explanations for anomalies in Mendeleev’s
classification of elements

1. Position of isotopes

Since all isotopes of an element have the same
number of protons, their atomic number is also the
same. And since all isotopes of an element have the
same atomic number, they can be put at the same
position in the periodic table.

2. Position of argon and potassium

The atomic number of argon is 18 and its mass
number is 40 while the atomic number of potassium
is 19 and its mass number is 39. Now, according to
the Modern periodic law, elements are arranged in
increasing order of their atomic number. So argon,
with its lower atomic number, should come first, and
potassium, with its higher atomic number, should
come later.

5.6 PERIODICITY IN THE MODERN PERIODIC
TABLE

When elements are arranged according to increasing
atomic number, those having an equal number of
valence electrons occur at regular intervals (or periods).
And, since the numbers of valence electrons of elements
show periodicity (regular repetition), chemical properties
show corresponding periodicity.

Consider a group of the periodic table, for
example, the first group of elements. Lithium,
sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium and francium,
respectively. They have atomic numbers 3, 11, 19,
37, 55 and 87.

They :

(i) are good reducing agents.
(ii) form unipositive ions.
(iii) are soft metals.
(iv) are very reactive and are thus found mainly in
combined state.
(v) impart colour to the flame when they burn.
(vi) form hydrides with hydrogen.
(vii) form basic oxides with oxygen.

(viii) react with water to form metal hydroxides and
hydrogen.

All these elements have one electron each in
their outermost shell (Refer 5.14), and so they have
similar properties.

It is noticed that elements with similar electronic
configurations have similar properties. Thus, the cause
of periodicity is same number of electron(s) in
outermost orbit i.e., recurrence of similar electronic
configuration.

Salient features of the modern periodic table
Vertical columns in the periodic table are called
groups and the horizontal rows are called periods.

GROUPS

(1) The modern periodic table has eighteen vertical
columns, comprising of groups (I to VIII and
zero). Note that groups, I to VII are divided into
sub-groups thereby making a total of eighteen
groups.

(2) Elements of sub-group A, i.e. of IA, TIA, TTA,
IVA, VA, VIA and VIIA, (Group number 1, 2,

According to the recommendation of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the
groups are numbered from I to 18 replacing the older notation of GROUPS IA.. VIIA, VIII, IB... VIB
and 0. However, for the examination, both notations will be accepted.

13, 14, 15, 16 and 17) are known as main group
elements or representative elements or the
normal elements. These elements have their
outermost shells incomplete.

(3) Elements of Group number 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11 and 12 are known as transition elements.
They have their two outermost shells incomplete.

(4) Elements in the Zero group (Group number 18)
are called noble gases because owing to their
stable electronic configurations, they hardly react
with other elements. (Eight electrons in the
outermost orbit, except in the case of Helium
which has 2 electrons).

PERIODS
There are seven horizontal rows in the modern
periodic table, each called a period. The number of

shells present in an atom determines its period, as is
clear from Table 8.2.

(1) Elements with electrons increasing arithmetically
in their outermost shell, i.e. one by one, till an
octet is attained, are placed in the same period.
The last element of each period has eight
electrons, except the first period He (2 electrons).

(2) The first period contains only two elements,
(atomic nos. 1 and 2). It is the shortest period.

(3) The second and third periods contain eight
elements each (atomic nos. 3-10 in the second
and atomic nos. 11-18 in the third period). These
are short periods.

(4) The fourth and fifth periods contain eighteen
elements each (atomic nos. 19-36 in the fourth
and atomic nos. 37-54 in the fifth period). These
are long periods.

(5) The sixth period contains 32 elements (atomic
nos. 55-86). It is the longest period.

(6) The seventh period (atomic nos. 87 and onward)
is as yet an incomplete period.

(7) In Group IIIB (Group number 3) of the sixth
period, there is a set of elements with atomic
numbers 57 to 71 (La - Lu), beginning with
lanthanum (La-57). These element are known as
lanthanides (rare earths).

(8) In Group IIIB (Group number 3) of the
seventh period, there is a set of elements with
atomic numbers 89 to 103 (Th — Lr), beginning
with actinium (Ac-89). These elements are
known as actinides (radioactive elements).

Lanthanides and actinides have similar properties because
they belong to the same group, Group III B. But they are
shown at the bottom of the periodic table because they are
large in number, and showing them in the main body of the
table will distort its shape.

5.7 TYPES OF ELEMENTS
Elements can also be classified in the following
four types :
1. Representative elements
2. Transition elements
3. Inner transition elements
4. Inert gases or noble gases
Classification according to s, p, d and f blocks is
based on electronic configuration, which you will
study in higher classes.
5.7.1 Representative elements
(s and p-block elements) : They include all
elements of :
Group 1 : Alkali metals — form strong alkalis
with water;
Group 2 : Alkaline earth metals — form weaker
alkalis compared to IA group elements;
Group 13 : Boron family — boron is the first
member of the group;
Group 14 : Carbon family — carbon being the
first member;
Group 15 : Nitrogen family, nitrogen being the
first member;
Group 16 : Oxygen family, oxygen being the first
member;
Group 17 : Halogens, they are salt formers.

The alkali metals (Group I) are the most reactive metals that
occur. They are known as the alkali metals because they react
vigorously with water to produce hydrogen and an alkali

solution.
Halogens (Group 17) are most reactive non-metals. They
form salts on reacting with metals.

Main characteristics of representative elements:

(a) They include both metals and non-metals. There
is a regular gradation from metallic to non-
metallic character as one moves from left to night
across the period.

(b) They form electrovalent as well as covalent
compounds with non-metals.

(c) Metallic nature increases, moving down any of
these seven groups.

Moon We


--- Page 9 ---
(d) Metals, which are good conductors of hdat

and electricity, are present in groups | and 2.
Non-metals, which are present in groups 16 and
17, are poor conductors of heat and electricity.

(e) Some heavier elements, like tin and lead, exhibit
variable valencies.

5.7.2. Transition elements (d-block elements) :
They are included in Groups 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11 and 12

Main characteristics of transition elements :

(a) All these elements are metals with high melting
and boiling points.

(b) They are good conductors of heat and electricity.

(c) Some of these elements are attracted towards a
magnet.

(d) Most of these elements are used as catalysts.

(e) Most of these elements exhibit variable valencies.

(f) Most of these elements form coloured ions and
coloured compounds.

5.7.3. Inner transition elements (f-block elements) :
The elements of the sixth and seventh periods of

Group 3, i.e. the lanthanides and the actinides, are

collectively known as inner transition elements.

Main characteristics of inner transition elements :
(a) They are heavy metals with high melting and
boiling points.
(b) They show variable valencies.
(c) They form coloured ions.
(d) Actinides are all radioactive by nature.

5.7.4. Inert gases (or noble gases)
Elements of the Zero group, which is the 18"
vertical column, are known as inert gases or noble gases.
They have 8 electrons in their outermost orbits
(except He, which has only 2). They do not react with
other elements and are, therefore, inert. (Refer 5.11.4.)

Bridge elements : Elements of the second period show
resemblance in properties with elements of the next group
of the third period, leading to a diagonal relationship.
Such elements are called bridge elements, viz. Li and Mg;
Be and Al; B and Si.

Typical elements
The third period elements, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S and Cl,
summarize the properties of their respective groups and are
called typical elements.

5.8 MERITS OF THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE

(1) It is based on atomic number, which is an
even better fundamental property compared
to atomic mass.

(2) Position of an element in the table is related
to its electronic configuration.

(3) It shows regular changes in properties of
elements on moving across a period or down
a group.

Properties that reappear at regular intervals, or in
which there is gradual variation, i.e. increase or
decrease at regular intervals, are called periodic
properties and the phenomenon is known as
periodicity of elements.

Cause of periodicity is recurrence of similar
electronic configuration.

In a particular group, the number of electrons in
the outermost orbit remains the same, i.e. electronic
configuration is similar. Valency also remains the
same. So elements of the same group have similar
properties, though the number of shells increases
down a group.

(4) Modern periodic table is easier to remember,
understand and reproduce.
5.9 DEFECTS OF THE MODERN PERIODIC
TABLE
1. Position of hydrogen is still not satisfactory,
as its properties relate to both Group | and
Group 17.

2. It fails to accommodate the inner transition
elements, i.e. the lanthanides and the actinides,
into the main body of the periodic table.

5.10 GENERAL TRENDS OF THE MODERN
PERIODIC TABLE

GROUPS

(1) Numbers of shells and valence electrons :

Number of shells increases arithmetically and
number of valence electrons remains equal to the
number of the group to which the element belongs.
Also, number of electron shells in a given element

(2) Valency :

Valency of an element equals the number of
electrons present in its valence shell. Since elements
in a particular group have an equal number of
electrons in their respective valence shells, valency
of all elements in a given group is the same. For
example, valency of any alkali metal is 1, as shown
in the table below.

(Group number 17; 18 — 17 = 1)
Valency of group Zero (or Group number 18)
elements is 0.

Valency of group IIA elements is 2

(3) Properties of elements :

Elements in a given group possess similar
electronic configurations. Because the number of
electrons in their respective outermost shells is the same
hence, they have very similar physical and chemical
properties, which change uniformly down that group.

EXAMpPles co
(a) Alkali metals (Group 1) are all very reactive,
and degree of reactivity further increases down
the group.
Li<Na <K<Rb<Cs
Reactivity increases
(b) Halogen atoms also are very reactive. But there
degree of reactivity decreases as we move from
fluorine to iodine.
F>Cl >Br>I

Reactivity decreases

KOC

(4) Atomic size :

As one moves down a
group, size of atoms of
successive elements increases.
This is because of progressive
increase in the number of shells.
For example, in Group 1, atomic
size increases as one moves
from lithium to caesium.

(5) Metallic character :

Metallic character increases Caesium : 2,8, 18,18, 8.1
as one moves down a group. For example, in
Group 15, nitrogen and phosphorus are non-metals,
arsenic and antimony are metalloids, and bismuth is
a typical metal.
Elements of Group 15:
Character :

As; Sb Bi

N; P

non—metals metalloids

It is on account of gradual increase in metallic
character of elements from top to bottom that oxides
of elements become increasingly basic in character
moving in the same direction.

The oxides of the elements

of Group 15: NO,;P,0,; As,O,; Sb,0, Bi, O,
3 3
Oxide character: acidic amphoteric basic

Note : Hydrogen has been placed at the top of Group
1, above the alkali metals of that group, because the
electronic configuration of hydrogen is similar to those
of the alkali metals. Both hydrogen and alkali metals
have 1 valence electron. However, hydrogen atom is
very small in size, and therefore, many of its properties

re OA i


--- Page 11 ---
are different from those of alkali metals. As such,
while discussing the alkali metals of group 1,
hydrogen is ignored. However, in some periodic
tables, hydrogen is not placed in any group. It is
treated as a very special element, and thus placed alone
at the head of the periodic table.

PERIODS
(1) Number of shells :

On moving from left to right in a given period,
number of shells remains the same.

For example, in the 3rd period, number of shells
remains three, i.e. equal to the number of period.

(2) Number of electrons in valence shell :

In a given period, number of electrons in valence
shell increases from left to right.
(3) Valency :

Valency of elements, with respect to hydrogen,
increases arithmetically from | to 4 and back to 1.

But valency of elements, with respect to oxygen,
increases from | to 7.

(4) Size of atoms :

Size of atom decreases when moving left to
right in a period (increase in the number of protons
increases nuclear pull which decreases the size). Thus,
in a particular period, alkali atoms have the largest
size and halogen atoms are the smallest.

(5) Properties of elements :

Properties of an element depend upon the
number of electrons in its outermost orbit. Since
in a period, number of electrons in valence shell
changes, properties of elements in a period
differ significantly. Reactivity first decreases up
to Group 14 and then increases. Thus Group 1
elements are the most reactive metals while those
of Group 17 are the most reactive non-metals.

(6) Metallic character :

On moving from left to right in a given period,
metallic character gradually decreases, i.e. it changes
from metallic to non-metallic. The last element of
each period is inert.

Elements of the 2nd period

Non-metal

Oxides of elements : Oxides of elements in a
particular period become progressively less basic and
finally change to an acidic character. For example,
consider the oxides of the third period elements.

Oxides of the 3rd period

5.11.2. Group II (Alkaline Earth Metals)

The elements such as beryllium (Be), magnesium
(Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba) and
radium (Ra) are known as alkaline earth metals, because
their oxides occur in the earth’s crust and their
hydroxides are weak alkalies.

All the elements of this group have two electrons
in their outermost orbit and show the valency two,
so they are placed in IIA group of the Periodic Table.

2. They are the most reactive non-metals. Their
reactivity decreases down the group. For
example, Fluorine is the most reactive and iodine
the least reactive halogen.

3. There is a steady increase in melting points and
boiling points as we go down the group. Fluorine
is a gas, chlorine is a gas, Bromine is liquid and
iodine is solid.

5.11.4 Group Zero or 18 group (Noble gases)

When Mendeleev first constructed his table,
there was no indication that a whole group of
elements (Group zero) remained to be discovered.
Because of their lack of reactivity. There was no clear
sign of their existence. However,analysis of the gases
in air led to the discovery of argon. Helium was first
detected by spectroscopy of light from the sun during
an eclipse and the other noble gases were isolated.
William Ramsay isolated these gases. He was
awarded the Nobel prize for this major contribution.

These gases (Helium, neon, argon, krypton,
xenon and radon) are refered to as inert gases
meaning they do not react at all. In 1960s some
compounds of xenon and krypton have been made
and their name was changed to noble gases.

Helium has 2 electrons in its shell, all the other
members have eight electrons in outermost orbit
i.e., their electronic arrangment is very stable, so
that they are unreactive.

2. All are colourless, tasteless, odourless gases. They
are neither inflammable nor supporter of
combustion.

3. They are monoatomic because their electronic
configuration is stable.

4. Noble gases are liquifted with great difficulty.
5. These gases are slightly soluble in water and on
moving from He to Rn solubility increases.

6. These gases emit coloured light when an
electrical discharge is passed through them.

7. Their melting points and boiling points are
extremely low. Helium has the lowest melting
point of any element, and cannot be solidified

by cooling alone (pressure is needed also). All
these properties point to the atoms of the noble
gases being particularly stable.

The uses of noble gases depend on their
unreactive nature. Helium is used in airships and
balloons because it is both light and unreactive.
Argon is used to fill light bulbs because it will
not react with the filament even at high
temperatures. The best known use of the noble
gases is, perhaps, its use in ‘neon’ lights. The
brightly coloured advertising light works, when
an electric discharge is passed in a tube
containing a little of a noble gas. Different gases
impart different colours.

Note : The elements of Group zero (18) are between
the two most reactive groups of elements [Groups
I and VIIA (17)]. Indeed, it is their closeness to
these groups with stable electron arrangments that
makes the alkali metals and the halogens so reactive.
They can easily achieve a noble gas electron
structure. The Group VIIA (17) elements gain or
share an electron while group IA lose an electron
to achieve a noble gas electron arrangment.

5.12 USES OF PERIODIC TABLE

1. Periodic table has been useful in predicting the
existence of new elements.

. It has been useful in the past in correcting the
properties of elements.

. Study of elements and their compounds has
become systematic and easier to remember.

. Position of an element in the periodic table reveals
its

(i) atomic number _ (ii) electronic configuration

(iii) number of valence electrons
(iv) properties

. Nature of chemical bond, formula of compound formed
and properties of that compound can all be predicted
from the periodic table.
For example : Elements present in groups
1, 2 and 3 (metals) lose electrons to form positive
ions, while elements of groups 15, 16 and 17 (non-
metals) gain electrons to form negative ions. When
these positive and negative ions combine, they form
a compound, that is electrovalent in nature.
If elements of groups 14, 15, 16 and 17 combine
with those of 15, 16 and 17, i.e. non-metals with
non-metals, they form covalent compounds.

6. Position of an element in the periodic table reveals

(i) Valency of an element.

(ii) whether the element is a metal or a non-metal —
metals occupy the extreme left positions at the
bottom of the periodic table while non-metals are
at the extreme right of the periodic table.

CHAPTER AT A GLANCE

Doberiener grouped the elements in triads (groups of three elements) such that the middle element of the triad had both atomic mass
and properties roughly equal to the average equivalent figures for the other two elements of the triad.

Examples : :

7+39

= 88-5 (ii) Li(7),  Na(23), K (39) : =23
Le

2

However, this method was soon discarded since only a few elements then known could be arranged in such triads.

Newland gave the law of octaves. According to it, when elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic mass,
every eighth element beginning from any element resembles the first in its physical and chemical properties. [Like the
eighth note on a musical scale resembling the first note].

This method too was soon discarded since it failed to accommodate the heavier elements and left no space for elements
that were discovered later. Moreover, after the discovery of the noble gases, the idea of octaves simply did not work.

In 1871, Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published a table of elements, and proposed a periodic law. It states that
“the properties of elements are the periodic functions of their atomic masses.” He arranged the elements in increasing order
of their atomic mass. This arrangement enabled Mendeleev to place elements in vertical columns known as groups and
horizontal rows known as periods. He even predicted the existence of some yet to be discovered elements. But even this
method could not explain the positions of certain elements like the rare earth metals and existence of isotopes.

These defects were removed when Moseley found that atomic numbers are the fundamental property that best explained
the periodic properties of elements. He then put forward the idea of the modern periodic table.
