(A) INDUCED MAGNETISM AND NEUTRAL POINTS

10.1 INTRODUCTION

The first known magnets were the pieces of
lodestone, an ore of iron oxide (Fe3;O,4) found in
large quantities in Magnesia, in Asia Minor. This
ore was found to possess two properties : (i) it
attracts small pieces of iron, and (ii) it sets itself
along a definite direction when it is suspended
Jreely. The Chinese, earlier than 2500 B.C., used
these pieces to guide their boats. The pieces of
lodestone found in nature were later on called
the natural magnets. The word magnet has been
derived from magnesia.

The natural magnets are found in quite
irregular and odd shapes. They are not
magnetically strong enough for use. Therefore,
for different uses, artificial magnets are prepared
from iron in different convenient sizes and
shapes such as bar magnet, horse shoe magnet,
magnetic needle, magnetic compass, etc.

If a magnet is suspended with a silk thread
such that it is free to rotate in a horizontal plane,
it sets itself always pointing in the geographic
north-south direction as shown in Fig. 10.1.
Depending on the direction in which an end of

the magnet rests, its polarity is named as north
or south.

Two like poles (both north poles or both
south poles) repel each other, while two unlike
poles (one north pole and the other south pole)
attract each other.

10.2. INDUCED MAGNETISM (MAGNETISM
INDUCED BY A BAR MAGNET ON THE
MAGNETIC MATERIALS)

When an unmagnetised bar AB of a magnetic
material such as soft iron or steel, is placed near or in
contact with a magnet as shown in Fig 10.2 (a), the
bar AB becomes a magnet i.e., it acquires the
property of attracting iron filings when they are
brought near its ends. If the magnet is now
removed, it is seen that nearly all the iron filings
which have clung to it, fall down ie., the bar AB
loses its magnetism [Fig. 10.2(b)]. Thus, the bar
of a magnetic material behaves like a magnet so

magnetism so produced is called induced
magnetism. Thus

material when it is kept 7 near ir {or La aigmact

The process in which a piece of magnetic
material acquires the magnetic properties
temporarily in presence of another magnet near
it, is called the magnetic induction.

If polarity at the ends A and B of the bar AB
is tested with a compass needle, it is found that
the polarity developed at the end A is north
(opposite to the polarity of the magnet near the
end A) and the polarity at end B is south (ie.,
similar to the polarity at the end of the magnet
near the end A). Thus,

‘A magnetic pole induces an opposite polarity
on the near end and a similar polarity.on the
farther end. of the iron bar.

Induction precedes attraction

Now we can explain how an ordinary piece
of iron is attracted towards a magnet. When a
piece of iron is brought near one end of a magnet
(or one end of a magnet is brought near the piece
of iron), the nearer end of the piece acquires an
opposite polarity by magnetic induction. Since
unlike poles attract each other, therefore iron piece
is attracted towards the end of the magnet. Thus,
piece of iron first becomes a magnet by induction
and then it is attracted. In other words, induction
precedes attraction.

Induced magnetism is temporary

If one pole of a bar magnet is brought near the
small iron nails, they form a chain of nails as shown
in Fig. 10.3. The reason is that the bar magnet by
induction magnetises an iron nail which gets
attracted by the magnet and clings to it. This

iS} BAR MAGNET Ya
RS

Fig. 10.3 Magnetic induction

magnetised nail magnetises the other nail near it
by magnetic induction and attracts it. This process
continues till force of attraction of magnet on first
nail is sufficient to balance the total weight of all
the nails in chain.

Now holding the uppermost nail in position by
fingers, if magnet is removed, we find that all nails
fall down. The reason is that on removing the
magnet, the uppermost nail loses its magnetism, so
all other nails also lose their magnetism, they get
separated from each other and they all fall down due
to force of gravity. This shows that the magnetism
acquired by induction is purely temporary. It lasts
so long as the magnet causing induction remains in
its vicinity.

10.3. LINES OF MAGNETIC FIELD

If a magnetic compass is placed on a table, it
is found that its needle rests in geographic north-
south direction*. But when it is placed near a
magnet, the needle swings and then rests in some
other direction. As the compass is placed at different
positions around a magnet, the direction in which
the needle rests, changes such that its one end always
points towards the nearer pole of the magnet. This
behaviour of needle is due to the influence of the
magnet near it. The region in which the compass
gets influenced is called the magnetic field of the
magnet.

The space around a magnet in which the needle
of a compass rests in a direction other than the
geographic north-south direction, is called
magnetic field of the magnet.

As the distance of point from the magnet
increases, the effect of its magnetic field
dicreases.

Magnetic field is a vector quantity. The
magnitude of magnetic field at a point is
measured by the force which a magnetic pole
placed at that point, experiences, while the
direction of magnetic field is the direction in
which the needle of compass rests when it is
placed at that point.

If we place a magnet below a sheet of stiff
paper (or a glass plate) and spread some iron
filings uniformly over the glass plate, then on
tapping the glass plate gently, the iron filings
arrange themselves along the curved lines as

* Due to the earth’s magnetic field.

194


--- Page 3 ---
shown in Fig. 10.4. The reason is that due to
magnet, each piece of iron filing gets
magnetised by magnetic induction and
experiences a force due to the magnet and
arrange itself along the curved line. These
curved lines are called the magnetic field lines.

When a compass needle is placed at any point
in a magnetic field, its needle rests along the
magnetic field line. An arrow is marked on the
magnetic field line from south pole of the needle
to its north pole. The arrow indicates the direction
of magnetic field at that point. Thus

10.4 PROPERTIES OF MAGNETIC FIELD
LINES

The magnetic field lines have following

properties :

(1) They are closed and continuous curves.

(2) Outside the magnet, they are directed from
the north pole towards the south pole of
the magnet*.

(3) The tangent at any point on a field line gives
the direction of magnetic field at that point.

(4) They never intersect one another. If two
field lines intersect, there would be two
directions of the magnetic field at that point
which is not possible. Fig 10.5 shows two
magnetic field lines PQ and PR intersecting

* Inside the magnet, the magnetic field lines are directed
from south pole towards the north pole and thus a closed
and contineous curve is formed.

ao

each other at a point P. It would mean that
if a compass needle is placed at the point
P, north pole of its needle will point in
two directions PQ and PR simultaneously
which is not possible.

Q

R

Fig. 10.5 A compass needle placed at the point P cannot
show the two directions PQ and PR simultaneously

(5) They are crowded near the poles of the
magnet where the magnetic field is strong
and are far separated near the middle of
the magnet and far from the magnet, where
the magnetic field is weak.

(6) Parallel and equi-distant field lines
represent a uniform magnetic field. The
earth's magnetic field in a limited space is
uniform.

(7) They behave like the stretched elastic rubber
strings.

MAGNETIC FIELD OF EARTH
(Evidences of existence of earth's
magnetic field)
Our earth itself has a magnetic field and it
behaves like a magnet. The existence of earth's
magnetic field is based on the following facts :

(i) A freely suspended magnetic needle always
rests in geographic north-south direction.

An iron rod buried inside the earth along
north-south direction becomes a magnet.

Neutral points are obtained on plotting the
field lines of a magnet where the net
magnetic field in zero.

A magnetic needle rests with its geometric
axis making different angles with horizontal
when suspended at different places on the earth.
(i) A freely suspended magnetic needle
always rests in geographic north-south direction
— When a magnetic needle (or a magnet) is
suspended such that it is free to rotate in a
horizontal plane, it always rests indicating the
geographic north-south direction. But the north
pole of a magnet will point towards the geographic

10.5

(ii)

195


--- Page 4 ---
north only when there is a magnetic south pole
attracting it. Similarly the south pole of the magnet
will point towards the geographic south when there
is a magnetic north pole attracting it. Therefore
we Can assume a magnet inside the earth which
must have its south pole in the geographic north
and north pole in the geographic south.

(ii) An iron red buried inside the
earth along north-south direction becomes a
magnet — If an iron rod is buried few metres
inside the earth keeping it along north-south
direction, after some days it is found that the rod
becomes a weak magnet. It is possible only if the
earth itself behaves like a magnet.

(iii) Neutral points are obtained on plotting
the field lines of a magnet — If a magnet is placed
in a horizontal plane with its north pole facing
towards the geographic north and the magnetic
field lines are plotted, we obtain two neutral points,
one on either side of the magnet, on its broad side-
on position. Similarly, if the magnet is placed in a
horizontal plane with its north pole facing towards
the geographic south and the magnetic field lines
are plotted, we obtain two neutral points, one on
either side of the magnet on its end-on position.
At each neutral point, the resultant magnetic field
is zero i.e., if a compass needle is placed at a
neutral point, it rests in any direction. The reason
for zero resultant magnetic field at the neutral point
is that the magnetic field produced by the magnet
is neutralised by some other equal and opposite
magnetic field. This other magnetic field is actually
the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
field.

(iv) A magnetic needle rests making
different angles with horizontal when
suspended at different places of the earth — If
a magnetic needle is suspended such that it is free
to rotate in a vertical plane and it is taken around
the earth through its geographic poles, we find
that at two places, magnetic needle becomes
normal to the earth surface i.e., it becomes vertical.
These points are called the earth's magnetic poles.
At two places it becomes parallel to the earth
surface i.e., it becomes horizontal. These points
lie on earth's magnetic equator. At other places, it
rests making different angles with the horizontal

as shown in Fig. 10.6. It implies that the earth
itself has a magnetic field.

Fig. 10.6 The magnetic needle at different
places on earth

Two places where the magnetic needle
becomes vertical are called the magnetic poles.

The line joining the places where the
magnetic needle becomes horizontal, is called
the magnetic equator.

Conclusion : On the basis of above facts, it
can be concluded that the earth behaves as if a
huge bar magnet is present at its centre with its
magnetic south pole in the geographic north and
the magnetic north pole in the geographic south.
Actually, the geographic poles do not coincide with
the earth's magnetic poles, but they are somewhat
displaced. The magnetic axis of the earth makes
an angle of 17° with the axis of rotation of the
earth. The magnetic south pole of earth is in
Canada at a distance nearly 2240 km from the
geographic north pole at 70-75° north latitude and
96° west longitude, while the earth's magnetic
north pole is at a distance nearly 2240 km from
the geographic south pole at 73° south latitude and
155° east longitude. It has been experimentally
observed that the positions of these poles are not
stationary, but they gradually change over a long
period of time.
Magnetic Field Lines of Earth

In a limited space, the magnetic field lines of
earth are parallel and equidistant to each other as
shown in Fig. 10.7(b). They are always directed
from the geographic south to the geographic north.
They are horizontal at the magnetic equator and
vertical at the magnetic poles, but at any other
point, they are inclined to the horizontal.

196

The magnetic field lines of the earth are normal
to earth surface near the magnetic poles
and parallel to earth surface near the magnetic
equator.

10.6 PLOTTING OF UNIFORM MAGNETIC
FIELD LINES OF EARTH

Earth's magnetic field is uniform in a
limited space. Experimentally we can plot
uniform magnetic field lines of earth as follows.

Experiment : Fix a sheet of paper on a
drawing board (or a table top) by means of brass
pins. Place a small compass needle at position 1
(Fig. 10.7 (a)] and looking from top of the
needle, mark two pencil dots exactly in front of
two ends of the needle. Then move the compass
needle to position 2 in such a way that one end of
the needle coincides with the second pencil dot.
Mark the position of the other end of needle with
a dot. Repeat the process of moving the compass
needle to position 3, 4, ... to obtain several dots.
On joining the different dots, you will get a
straight line. Thus one magnetic field line of
earth is traced.

Repeat the process starting from a different
point and trace out another magnetic field line. In
this manner, draw several magnetic field lines
Starting from the different points. Label each line
with an arrow from the south pole of needle
towards the north pole to indicate the direction of
the magnetic field. Fig. 10.7 (b) shows several
magnetic field lines so obtained.

It is noticed that these lines do not intersect
each other. They are parallel and equidistant.
They are directed from geographic south to
geographic north (i.e., the direction in which a
magnetic needle, suspended freely in a horizontal
plane, rests).

10.7 PLOTTING OF NON UNIFORM
MAGNETIC FIELD OF A STRONG BAR
MAGNET AND NEUTRAL POINTS

The magnetic field around a bar magnet (or
a horse shoe magnet) is non-uniform. The
magnetic field lines in a non-uniform magnetic
field are not equispaced and parallel, but they
are curved (either converging or diverging). The
closely spaced magnetic field lines at a place
represent a strong magnetic field at that place,
while the widely spaced magnetic field lines at
a place represent a weak magnetic field at that
place. Fig. 10.8 shows the non-uniform magnetic
field lines due to (a) a bar magnet, (b) a horse
shoe magnet, (c) two unlike poles facing each
other and (d) two like poles facing each other.

We shall now plot the non-uniform
magnetic field lines of a bar magnet placed in
the magnetic meridian (i.e., along the direction
in which a freely suspended magnet rests) in the
following two positions :

(1) When the magnet is placed with its north
pole pointing towards north.

(2) When the magnet is placed with its south
pole pointing towards north.

pole pointing towards north

middle of the paper by keeping a compass needle on it.
Draw a line along this direction and place a bar magnet
on the paper along this line with its north pole pointing
towards north. Mark its outline with a fine pencil. Now
place the compass needle close to the north pole of the
magnet and looking from above, mark two pencil dots
exactly in front of two ends of the needle. Then move
the compass needle in such a way that one end of the
needle coincides with the second pencil dot. Mark
position of the other end of the needle with a dot. Repeat
the process of moving the compass needle till other end
of the bar magnet is reached. Join different dots to get a
continuous smooth curve. Thus, one magnetic field line
is traced.

Repeat the process from the same pole of the
magnet, but starting from a different point and trace out
another magnetic field line. In this manner, draw
several magnetic field lines starting from the different
points near the same pole of the magnet. Label each
line with an arrow from the north pole towards the
south pole of the magnet (or from south pole of
compass needle to its north pole) to indicate the
direction of magnetic field at that place.

Fig. 10.9 Magnetic field lines of a bar
magnet when its north pole N faces geographic north

The magnetic field lines obtained are shown
in Fig. 10.9. These are due to the combined
effect of (i) the magnetic field of magnet and
(ii) the earth's magnetic field.

From Fig. 10.9, it is noted that

(i) The magnetic field lines are curved in
the vicinity of magnet. They are mainly due to
the magnetic field of magnet which is stronger
than the magnetic field of the earth. As the
distance from the magnet increases, the strength
of the magnetic field due to the magnet decreases

and at distant points, it becomes weaker than the
earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field lines
are therefore parallel to each other at distant
points. Here they are mainly due to the earth's
magnetic field. ;

(ii) There are two points equidistant from
the centre of the magnet marked as x in
Fig. 10.9 in east and west directions where the
magnetic field of the magnet and the horizontal
component of the earth's magnetic field are equal
in magnitude and they are in opposite directions
such that they neutralise each other. These are
the neutral points. A compass needle when
placed at these points, remains unaffected and
the needle rests in any direction.

(2) When the magnet is placed with its south

pole pointing towards north

In this case, the bar magnet is placed on
the paper along the magnetic meridian with its
south pole pointing towards north and lines of
magnetic field are traced following the same
method as described above. Fig. 10.10 shows
the magnetic field lines due to the combined
effect of (i) the magnetic field of the magnet
and (ii) the earth's magnetic field.

Fig. 10.10 Magnetic field lines of a bar magnet
when its north pole N faces geographic south

From Fig. 10.10, we notice that

(i) The magnetic field lines are curved in
the vicinity of the magnet and they are mainly
due to the magnetic field of the magnet which
is much stronger than the earth’s magnetic field.
As the distance from the magnet increases, the



--- Page 7 ---
strength of the magnetic field due to the magnet
decreases and at distant points, it becomes
weaker than the earth's magnetic field. The
magnetic field lines are nearly parallel straight
lines from south to north, at the distant points
from the magnet. They are mainly due to the
earth's magnetic field.

(ii) There are two points equidistant
from the centre of the magnet marked as x in
Fig. 10.10 in the north and south directions
where the magnetic field of the magnet and the
horizontal component of the earth's magnetic
field are equal in magnitude and they are in
opposite directions such that the two fields
neutralise each other. At these points, the
compass needle remains unaffected and the
needle comes to rest pointing in any direction.
These points are the neutral points.

10.8 NEUTRAL POINTS"

magnetic field at the neutral.p points: i: ‘zene.

The neutral points are _ situated
symmetrically on either side of a magnet at equal
distances from the centre in east-west direction,
if the north pole of the magnet faces towards
geographic north. But the neutral points are on
either side of the magnet at equal distances from
the centre in north-south directions, if south pole
of the magnet faces towards geographic north. If
a compass needle is placed at the neutral points,
it remains unaffected (i.e., it comes to rest
pointing in any direction) because the net
magnetic field at these points is zero.

(B) ELECTROMAGNET AND ITS USES

10.9 ELECTROMAGNET

An electromagnet can be made in any shape,
but usually the following two shapes of
electromagnet are in use :

(a) I-shape (or bar) magnet, and
(b) U-shape (or horse-shoe) magnet.

(a) Construction of the I-shaped (or bar)
electromagnet

To construct an I-shaped electromagnet, a thin
insulated copper wire is wound in form of a
solenoid around a straight soft iron bar PQ. The
ends of the wire are connected to a battery B
through an ammeter A, a rheostat Rh and a key K
as shown in Fig 10.14.

When current is passed through the winding
of solenoid by closing the key K, the end P of
the bar becomes the south pole (S) since current
at this face is clockwise, while the end QO at which
the current is anticlockwise, becomes the north
pole (N). Thus the bar becomes a magnet. The
bar shows the magnetic properties only when an

ie @

electric current flows through the solenoid and it
loses the magnetic properties as soon as the
current is switched off (since soft iron has a low
retentivity), thus it is a temporary magnet. Such
arrangement is commonly used in a relay.*

(b) Construction of the U-shaped (or horse-

shoe) electromagnet

To construct a horse-shoe electromagnet, a
thin insulated copper wire is spirally wound on
the arms of a U-shaped soft iron core, such that
the winding on the two arms as seen from the
ends, is in opposite sense. In Fig. 10.15, winding
on the arm P starts from the front and it is in
the clockwise direction (when viewed from the
bottom). On reaching the upper end of the
arm P, winding starts from the back at the top
of the arm Q and it is in anticlockwise direction.

Fig. 10.15 Horse-shoe electro-magnet

When current is passed through the winding

by closing the key, the end of the arm P becomes
the south pole S (current at this face is clockwise)
and the end of the arm Q becomes the north
pole N (current at this face is anti-clockwise).
Thus we get a very strong magnetic field in the
gap between the two poles. The magnetic field
in the gap vanishes as soon as the current in the
circuit is switched off. Thus it is a temporary
magnet. Such magnets are used in d.c. motor, a.c.
generator, etc.
Note : For sending current in the coil, the source
must be the d.c. source (i.e., battery). With an
a.c. source of frequency SO Hz, although the soft
iron core gets magnetised as long the current is
passed, but its polarity magnetics as long to
current is passed, but its polarity at the ends
changes 50 times in each second.

Ways of increasing the magnetic field of an
electromagnet
The magnetic field of an electromagnet
(I or U-shaped) can be increased by the following
two ways :
(i) by increasing the number of turns of
winding in the solenoid, and
(ii) by increasing the current through the
solenoid.

10.10 PERMANENT MAGNET
A permanent magnet is a naturally occuring

magnet. Since it is not strong enough and of
required shape for many purposes, so a strong

permanent magnet is made like an electromagnet
using steel instead of soft iron. A coil of insulated
copper wire is wound around the steel piece and
then current is passed in the coil. Once magnetised,
it does not lose its magnetism easily (since steel
has more retentivity than soft iron) so it becomes
a permanent magnet. The permanent magnets are
used in electric meters (e.g., galvanometer,
ammeter, voltmeter) and in magnetic compass,
etc.

10.12 ADVANTAGES OF AN ELECTRO-
MAGNET OVER A PERMANENT
MAGNET

An electromagnet has the following
advantages over a permanent magnet :

(i) An electromagnet can produce a strong
magnetic field.

(ii) The strength of the magnetic field of an
electromagnet can easily be changed by
changing the current (or the number of turns)
in its solenoid.

(iii) The polarity of the electromagnet can be

reversed by reversing the direction of current

in its solenoid.

10.13 USES OF ELECTROMAGNETS

Electromagnets are mainly used for the
following purposes :

(i) For lifting and transporting heavy iron scrap,
girders, plates, etc. particularly when it is not
convenient to take the help of human labour.
Electromagnets are used to lift as much as
20,000 kg of iron in a single lift. To unload
the iron objects at the desired place, the
current in the electromagnet is switched off
‘so that the iron objecis get detached.

(ii) For loading the furnaces with iron.

(iii) For separating the iron pieces from debris
and ores, where iron exists as impurities (e.g.,
for separating iron from the crushed copper
ore in copper mines).

(iv) For removing pieces of iron from wounds.

(v) In scientific research, to study the magnetic
properties of a substance in a magnetic field.

(vi) In several electrical devices such as electric
bell, telegraph, electric tram, electric motor,
relay, microphone, loud speaker, etc.

Use of electromagnet in an electric bell
An electric bell is one of the most commonly

used application of an electromagnet.
Construction and wiring : An electric bell

is shown in Fig. 10.16.

The main parts of the bell are :
(i) a horse-shoe electromagnet M, having a
soft iron core,

SCREW

BATTERY K switcH

(ii) a soft iron armature A,
(iii) a hammer H,
(iv) a gong G,
(v) a metallic spring strip SS,
(vi) an adjusting screw S’,
(vii) a switch (or bell-push) K, and
(viii) a battery.

The armature A is fixed to the spring strip
SS. The hammer H is attached at the upper end
of the armature A. When the switch K is not
pressed, the strip SS makes contact with the
adjusting screw S’ and there is a gap between
the armature A and the poles of the electromagnet.

The coil CC is wound on the two arms of the
electromagnet in the opposite direction as shown
in Fig. 10.16. One end of the coil is connected to
the terminal 7, through the strip SS and the screw
S’, while the other end is connected to the
terminal T,. A battery is provided in series with
the switch K across the terminals 7, and T,,.

Working and function of each part : When
the electric circuit is closed by pressing the
switch K, the current flows through the coil CC
and the core of the electromagnet gets magnetised
and therefore it attracts the armature A as shown
by an arrow in Fig. 10.16. Due to movement of
the armature A, the hammer AH strikes the
gong G and the bell rings.

At the moment, when the armature A, due
to magnetic attraction, moves towards the
electromagnet, the connection between the
strip SS and the screw S’ breaks due to which the
flow of current in the coil stops. Consequently,
the electromagnet loses magnetism (i.e., it gets
demagnetised) and the armature A flies back to
its original position due to the spring effect of
the strip SS. Now the armature A again touches
the screw S’, resulting in the flow of current in
the coil. The electromagnet regains its magnetism
and the armature A is again attracted, so the
hammer H again strikes the gong G. This process
continues.

This process of make and break of the circuit
goes on and the hammer strikes the gong repeatedly
so the bell rings as long as the switch K is kept
pressed.

Note : If an a.c. source is used in place of battery,
the core of electromagnet will get magnetised,
but the polarity at its ends will change. Since

attraction of armature does not depend on the
polarity of electromagnet, so the bell will still
ring on pressing the switch K.

electromagnet from a soft iron bar AB.
Mark the polarity at its ends. What
precaution would you observe ?

The labelled diagram is shown in Fig. 10.17.
