(A) CONTACT AND NON-CONTACT FORCES

3.1 FORCE

We are familiar that a force when applied on
a body can produce the following two main
effects :

(1) It can change the state of rest or of
motion of the body i.e., it can produce motion in
the body.

Examples : The push exerted by a broom
moves the trash. A ball lying on the ground moves
when it is kicked. The pull exerted by a horse
moves a cart. The pull exerted by a steam engine
moves a train. The force due to gravity (or the
earth’s pull) makes an apple fall. A fielder on the
ground stops a moving ball by applying force with
his hands.

When force is applied on the pedal by a
cyclist, the speed of the cycle increases. A freely
falling object continuously gains speed due to
the earth’s pull acting along its direction of
motion. The speed of a moving vehicle is
slowed down by applying the brakes. A stone

54

tied to one end of a string, whirling at a
constant speed in a horizontal circle, changes
its direction of motion continuously due to the
force of tension in the string (which acts normal
to the direction of motion of stone). In cricket,
tennis and badminton, the direction of motion
and the speed of the ball (or cock) is changed
by hitting it in the direction other than its
direction of motion. A player applies force with
a hockey stick to change the speed and direction
of motion of the ball.

(2) It can change the size or shape of the

body i.e., it can change the dimensions of the
body.
Examples : By loading a spring hanging

from a rigid support, the length of the spring
increases. By hammering a small piece of silver
sheet, a big thin foil is made (here the force
increases the surface area). The steam pushing
out from a pressure cooker occupies a large
volume in the atmosphere. On pressing a piece


--- Page 2 ---
of rubber, its shape changes. In a cycle pump,
when the piston is lowered, the air is compressed
to occupy a smaller volume.

Note : A force when applied on a rigid
object does not change the inter-spacing between
its constituent particles and therefore it does not
change the dimensions of the object, but causes
only the motion in it. On the other hand, a force
when applied on a non-rigid object, changes the
inter-spacing between its constituent particles and
therefore causes a change in its dimensions and
can also produce motion in it. Thus

ae v ~.

Kinds of forces : From the point of view of
application, the forces are classified in two
categories, namely, (i) the contact forces and
(ii) the non-contact forces.

3.2 CONTACT FORCES

The forces which are applied on bodies by
making a physical contact, are called the contact
forces. .

These forces are produced and experienced
when a body comes in contact with another body.

Examples : (1) The force of friction (frictional
force), (2) normal reaction force, (3) Force of
tension exerted by a string, (4) Force exerted by
a spring, (5) Force exerted on two bodies during
collision, etc.

(1) Frictional force : When a body slides (or
rolls) over a rough surface, a force starts
acting on the body in a direction opposite
to the motion of the body, along the surface
in contact. This is called the frictional force
or the force of friction. In Fig. 3.1, when a
book placed on the table top is pushed to

the right, the force of friction acts on the .
book towards the left. This force resists the

motion of the book on the table top.
Normal reaction force : When a body is
placed on a surface, the body exerts a force
downwards, equal to its weight, on the
surface, but the body does not move (or fall)
because the surface exerts an equal and
opposite force on the body normal to the
surface which is called the normal reaction
force. For example, in Fig. 3.2, when you
hold a block on your palm, the block exerts
a force due to its weight downwards on your
palm and you have to exert a reaction force
upwards on the block normal to the palm to
keep the block in position. Similarly in
Fig. 3.1, the book exerts a force (= weight)
on the table top downwards and the table
top exerts an equal reaction force upwards
normal to the top of the table.

Tension force as applied through strings :
When a body is suspended by a string attached
to a rigid support, the body, due to its weight
W, pulls the string vertically downwards and
the string in its stretched condition pulls
the body upwards by a force which balances
the weight of
the body. This
force developed
in the string is
called tension
(or the force of
tension) T.

(1) Gravitational force : In universe, each

particle attracts the other particle due to its
mass. This force of attraction between them
is called the gravitational force.
The earth also, because of its mass, attracts
all other masses around it. The force on a
body due to earth’s attraction is called the
force of gravity or the weight of the body.
It causes motion in the body towards
the earth (i.e., downwards) if the body is
free to move. Thus, it is the force due to
gravity that makes a body fall, when
released from a height. The body also
attracts the earth by an equal force, but no
motion is caused in the earth because of its
huge mass.
Examples : (i) A ball placed on a table
starts rolling down when the table is tilted.
(ii) If a body is thrown up in air, it goes
up, reaches to a height and then returns
to the ground.
(iii) A coin falls down when it is released
at a height.

(2) Electrostatic force : Two like charges

repel, while two unlike charges attract each
other. The force between the charges is
called the electrostatic force. This force acts
between the charged objects even when they
are separated.

Example : When a comb is rubbed on dry
hairs, it gets charged. If this comb is brought
near the small bits of paper, opposite

Ans. Contact force : (a), (b) and (c),
Non-contact force : (d), (e) and (f)

57

(3)

charges are induced on the bits of paper and
they begin to move towards the comb.
The motion of paper bits is due to the
electrostatic force of attraction exerted
between the unlike charges on the comb and
the paper bits.
Magnetic force : Two like magnetic poles
repel, while two unlike magnetic poles
attract each other. The force between the
magnetic poles is called the magnetic force.
This force acts even when the magnetic
poles are at a separation.

Example : When a pole of a magnet is
brought near a small iron nail (without
touching it), an opposite polarity is induced
on the nail and it moves towards the
magnet. The motion of nail is due to the
magnetic force of attraction exerted between
the unlike poles on the magnet and the nail.

General character of non-contact forces ~

(i)

(ii)

The gravitational force is always of
attractive nature, while the electrostatic
force and the magnetic force can be either
attractive or repulsive.

The magnitude of non-contact forces on the
two bodies depends on the distance of
separation between them. It decreases with
the increase in separation and increases as
the separation decreases. It varies inversely
as the square of distance of separation
i.e., on doubling the separation, the force
becomes one-fourth.

Give one example in each case where :

(a) the force is of contact, and

(b) force is at a distance.

of the roof. Draw a neat labelled diagram
showing the forces acting on the ball and
the string.

(B) NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION AND INERTIA

3.4 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION
In chapter 2, we have read the linear motion.
Now the question arises : what is the cause of
motion (i.e., what produces motion in an object) ?
It is our common experience that a force is to be
applied on an object to produce motion in it.

Examples : To move a cycle, the cyclist has
to apply force on its pedal. In a car, the petrol
engine provides the force needed to move the car.
To move a horse-cart, the horse applies force by
stretching its muscles. To move a boat ahead, a
force is applied by the oar on the water to push
it backward and the force of reaction exerted by
water moves the boat ahead.

Before Galileo, the scientists were of view that
a force is needed not only to start a motion but also
to keep an object moving even with uniform velocity.
In other words, an object remains in motion so long
as the external force applied to produce motion
remains present (i.e., a force must apply continuously
to keep the body in motion). This view was based
on the observation that the motion of a body ceases
when force is withdrawn from it.

Examples : A cycle remains moving so long
the force is applied on its pedal. If we stop pushing
the pedal, the cycle stops. Similarly, if we put off
the engine of a car, the car stops. The horse-cart
stops after the horse stops moving and the boat
stops after we stop pushing the oar.

«58

Galileo did not approve the above view. From
his experiments, he found that no force is needed
to continue the motion of a moving body. If a body
is set in motion, it will remain in motion even
when the force applied to set the body in motion
is withdrawn, provided that there is no other force
such as friction etc., to oppose the motion. From
our everyday life experience, we know that a cycle
does not stop at once as we stop pedalling, but it
moves a certain distance before coming to rest. In
fact it stops due to the force of friction between
its tyres and road, and also due to friction between
its moving parts. If friction between its moving
parts is reduced by proper oiling (or greasing) and
it is made to move on a smooth road, it travels
comparatively a much longer distance before
coming to rest, after pedalling is stopped. If
somehow it would have been possible to reduce
the force of friction completely, the cycle would
have remained in motion forever even when
pedalling is stopped. Thus, it is concluded that in
the absence of the force of friction, no force is
required to keep an object moving after bringing
it in motion. In other words, an object, if once set
in motion, moves with uniform velocity if no force
acts on it. Thus a body continues to be in the state
of rest or in the state of uniform motion unless an
external force is applied on it. This is called the
Galileo's law of inertia.


--- Page 6 ---
From the above discussion, we note that

(i) Ifa body is at rest, it remains at rest unless
a force is applied on it.

(ii) Ifa body is moving, it will continue to move
with the same speed in the same direction
unless a force is applied on it.

Newton put the above observations in the
form of a law which is called the Newton’s first
law of motion.

Qualitative discussion
Newton’s first law can be understood in the
following two parts :

(i) definition of inertia, and
(ii) definition of force.

(i) Definition of inertia : In the first part,
Newton’s first law gives the definition of
inertia, according to which an object cannot
change its state by itself. If the object is in the
state of rest, it will remain in the state of rest
and if it is moving in some direction, it will
continue to move with the same speed in the
same direction unless an external force is
applied on it.

Examples : A book lying on a table top will
remain placed at its place unless it is displaced.
Similarly, a ball rolling on a horizontal plane
keeps on rolling unless the force of friction
between the ball and the plane stops it.

: The second part of
Newton’s first law defines the force,
according to which force is that external
cause which can move a stationary object
or which can change the state of motion of
a moving object.

59

Examples : A book lying on a table gets
displaced from its place when it is pushed. A
moving bicycle stops when a retarding force is
applied by the brakes on its wheels.

Note : (i) Force is a vector quantity. (ii) The
sum of two equal and opposite forces is zero.
(iii) A body acted upon by several forces can also
have the resultant net force on it, equal to zero.

3.5 MASS AND INERTIA

Inertia is an inherent property of each body by
virtue of which it has a tendency to resist the change
in its state of rest or state of motion. The property
of inertia is because of the mass of the body. The
greater the mass, the greater is the inertia of body.
Thus, a lighter body has less inertia than a heavier
body. In other words, more the mass of a body,
more difficult it is to move the body from rest (or
to stop the body if it is initially in motion). Thus
mass is a measure of inertia.

Examples : (1) A cricket ball is more massive
than a tennis ball. The cricket ball acquires much
smaller velocity than a tennis ball when the two
balls are pushed with equal force for the same
duration. In case when they are moving with the
same velocity, it is more difficult to stop the
cricket ball (which has more mass) in comparison
to the tennis ball (which has less mass).

(2) It is difficult (i.e., a larger force is
required) to set a loaded trolley (which has more
mass) in motion than an unloaded trolley (which
has less mass). Similarly, it is difficult to stop a
loaded trolley than an unloaded one, if both are
moving initially with the same velocity.

3.6 KINDS OF INERTIA AND ITS EXAMPLES
AS ILLUSTRATION OF FIRST LAW
Inertia is of the following two kinds :

(1) Inertia of rest, and (2) Inertia of motion.
(1) Inertia of rest

If a body is at rest, it will remain at rest
unless an external force is applied to change its
state of rest. This property of body is called the
inertia of rest.


--- Page 7 ---
Examples : '

(1) When a train suddenly starts moving
forward, the passenger standing in the
compartment tends to fall backwards : The
reason is that the lower part of the passenger’s
body is in close contact with the train. As the train
starts moving, his lower part shares the motion at
once, but the upper part due to inertia of rest
cannot share the motion simultaneously and so it
tends to remain at the same place. Consequently,
the lower part of the body moves ahead and the
upper part is left behind, so the passenger tends
to fall backwards.

(2) When a hanging carpet is beaten with
a stick, the dust particles start falling out of
it : The reason is that the part of the carpet
where the stick strikes, comes in motion at
once, while the dust particles settled on its fur,
remain in position due to inertia of rest. Thus,
the part of the carpet moves ahead with the
stick, leaving behind the dust particles which
fall down due to the earth’s pull.

(3) On shaking (or giving jerks to) the
branches of a tree, the fruits fall down : The
reason is that when the stem (or branches) of
the tree are shaken, they come in motion, while
the fruits due to inertia, remain in the state of
rest. Thus, the massive and weakly attached
fruits get detached from the branches and fall
down due to the pull of gravity.

(4) On striking the coin at the bottom of
a pile of carrom coins with a striker, lowest
coin only moves away, while the rest of the
pile remains intact : The reason is that as the
striker hits the lowest coin, it moves (i.e.,
changes its state of rest), while the remaining
pile due to inertia of rest remains where it is
and ultimately takes the place of the original
pile due to the force of gravity.

(5) When a smooth card placed over the
mouth of a tumbler is flicked sharply in the
horizontal direction, the card flies away, but
the coin kept over the card falls into the
tumbler : The reason is that when the card is
flicked [Fig. 3.7(a)], a momentary force acts on
the card, so it moves away [Fig. 3.7(b)}. But the

_ COIN

TUMBLER

Fig. 3.7 Falling of coin kept on card

coin kept on it does not share the motion at
once and it remains at its place due to inertia
of rest. The coin then falls down into the
tumbler due to the pull of gravity.

(6) When a corridor train suddenly starts,
the sliding doors of some compartments may
open : The reason is that the frame of sliding
door being in contact with the floor of the train
also comes in motion on start of the train, but
the sliding door remains in its position due to
inertia. Thus the frame moves ahead with the
train while door slides opposite to the direction
of motion of the train. Thus the door may open.

(2) Inertia of motion

A body in a state of motion, continues to be
in the state of motion with the same speed in
the same direction in a straight line unless an
external force is applied on it to change its
state. This property of body is called the imertia
of motion.

Examples :

(1) A cyclist riding along a level road does
not come to rest immediately after he stops
pedalling : The reason is that the bicycle
continues to move due to inertia of motion even
after the cyclist stops applying the force on the
pedal. The bicycle comes to rest afterwards as
a result of the retarding force of friction
between the tyres of bicycle and the ground.

(2) When a passenger jumps out of a
moving train, he falls down : This is so because
inside the train, his whole body was in a state
of motion with the train. On jumping out of the
moving train, as soon as his feet touch the
ground, the lower part of his body comes to rest,
while the upper part still remains in motion due
to inertia of motion. As a result, he falls in the
direction of motion of the train and gets hurt.

To avoid falling, as the passenger’s feet
touch the ground, he should start running on

60

some distance.

(3) When a running car stops suddenly, the
passenger tends to lean forward : The reason is
that in a running car, the whole body of the
passenger is in the state of motion. When the car
stops suddenly, the lower part of his body, being
in contact with the car, comes to rest immediately
but his upper part remains in the state of motion,
due to inertia. Thus his body leans forward.

(4) An athlete often runs before taking a long
jump : The reason is that by running he brings his

is in motion, it becomes easier to take a long jump.

(5) A ball thrown vertically upwards by a
person in a moving train comes back to his
hand: The reason is that at the moment when
ball was thrown, it was in motion alongwith the
person and the train. It remains in the same
state of forward motion even during the time
the ball remains in air. The person, the inside
air and the ball, all move ahead by the same
distance due to inertia and so the ball falls back
into his palm on its return.

(C) LINEAR MOMENTUM AND NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION

3.7 LINEAR MOMENTUM (p = my)

It is our common experience that if two bodies
of different masses are moving with the same
velocity and they are brought to rest in same time,
the force needed to stop the heavier body is more
than that for the lighter body. Similarly, if two
bodies of the same mass are moving with different
velocities, then to stop them in the same time, the
force needed for the faster moving body is more
than for the slower moving body. Thus, the force
needed to stop a moving body in a definite time
depends both on the mass of the body and its
velocity. Actually the force needed to stop a
moving body in a given time depends on the
product of both the mass and velocity which is
called the Linear momentum of the moving body.
Thus

The linear momentum of a body is denoted
by the letter p. Generally the word momentum
is used for linear momentum.

For a body of mass m moving with velocity
v, linear momentum p is expressed as

It is a vector quantity in the direction of
motion of the body (i.e., along the velocity of
body).

Thus, the S.I. unit of momentum is kg m s'!
and the C.GS. unit is g cms”.

3.8 CHANGE IN MOMENTUM (Ap = mAv)
From eqn. (3.1), change in momentum
Ap = A(mv) (3.2)
Here the symbol A (called del or delta) before
a quantity denotes a small change in that quantity.
The change in product mv can be either due
to change in mass m or due to change in velocity
v or due to change in both the mass m and
velocity v. If mass remains constant, then change
in momentum is due to change in velocity v
alone. Then from eqn. (3.2), for constant mass,
change in momentum
Ap = A(mv) = mAv w.(3.3)*

In case of atomic particles moving
with velocity comparable to the velocity of
light c (= 3 x 108 m s~!)**, it was observed
that the mass of the particle does not
remain constant, but it increases with
increase/in velocity, according to the relation

m = m, y1-(v/c)” where m, is the mass of the

particle when it is at rest (7.e., v = 0). In such a
case, we cannot write A(mv) = mAv. The relation
Ap = mAv is true only if the velocity v of the
* The symbol A before mv denotes a small change in
the product of m and v. If mass m does not change, the
product mv will change only due to change in v, and so
m can be written before the symbol A. The quantity Ay
now represents a small change in v only.

** ¢ is the ultimate speed. No material particle can
acquire a speed equal to or greater than c.


--- Page 10 ---
moving particle is much smaller than the velocity
of light c (or v << c). It happens when the
velocity of particle is of the order of 106 m s™!
or less than this, then the variation in mass with
velocity is small enough and mass can be
considered to be constant. However the relation
Ap = A(my) is always true, whether mass m
varies* or it remains constant.

3.9 RATE OF CHANGE OF MOMENTUM

When a force is applied on a moving body,
its velocity changes. Due to change in velocity
of the body, its momentum also changes.

Let a force F be applied on a body of mass
m for time ¢ due to which its velocity changes
from u to v. Then

Initial momentum of the body = mu
Final momentum of the body = mv
Change in momentum of the body in t second
= mv —mu = m(v —u)
Rate of change of momentum
_ Changeinmomentum = m(v—u)
7 Time ~ t

Change in velocity —§ ¥—¥#

But acceleration a =
Time t

. (3.4)

This relation holds true when mass of the body
remains constant.

Thus when a force acts on a body, the rate of
change in momentum of body is equal to the
product of mass of the body and acceleration
produced in it due to that force, provided that the
mass of the body remains constant.

Alternative method

For a body of mass m moving with velocity
v, its linear momentum is p = mv. In time At, if
its linear momentum changes by Ap on applying
a force on it, then the rate of change of linear
momentum is

Ap A(mv) Av . ;
a ra =m w (if mass m remains constant)

* For example in rocket motion, the mass of rocket
decreases as the burnt gases expel out of the nozzle,
so the mass does not remain constant.

3.10 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION
(DERIVATION OF F = ma)

Newton’s first law of motion defines the force
only qualitatively. A force changes the state of
motion of a body when it is applied on it. It means
that the force produces acceleration in the body
i.e., the force is the cause of acceleration. Now we
shall see that the Newton’s second law of motion
gives the quantitative value of force, i.e., it relates
force to the measurable quantities like acceleration
and mass.

It is our common experience that if we push a
tennis ball gently, a small acceleration is produced
and it acquires a small velocity in a certain time,
but if the same tennis bal] is pushed hard, a larger
acceleration is produced in it and it acquires a large
velocity in the same time interval. Thus the
magnitude of two forces can be compared by
measuring the accelerations produced by them
when they are applied one by one on the same body.
If a force F, produces an acceleration of 5 m s?
and a force F, produces an acceleration of
10 m s~ on the same body, then the magnitude of
force F, is two times the magnitude of force F;.
Experimentally Newton found that the
acceleration produced in a body is directly
proportional to the force applied on it.

Similarly if we try to produce same change in
velocity in the same time (i.e., to produce same
acceleration) in a football and a tennis ball, initially
both at rest, we need to apply a large force on the
football than on the tennis ball. Thus the force
needed to produce same acceleration in two bodies
of different masses is not same. It is more for the
body of larger mass and less for the body of smaller
mass. If a force F is needed to produce an
acceleration of 5 m s~? in a body of mass 2 kg, then
to produce same acceleration (= 5 m s~*) in a body
of mass 4 kg, the force needed is of double the
magnitude i.e. 2F. Experimentally Newton found
that the force needed to produce same acceleration
in different bodies is proportional to their masses.

3.12 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION
IN TERMS OF RATE OF CHANGE OF
MOMENTUM

When force is applied on a body, it produces
acceleration in the body due to which the velocity
and hence the momentum of body changes.

From eqn. (3.4), the rate of change of
momentum is equal to the product of mass
and acceleration i.e.,

Ap

ar ma (if mass remains constant).

From eqn. (3.8), by Newton’s second law of
motion, force F = ma.

Explanation

According to Newton’s second law of motion,

pa OP _ Aimy)

At
Newton’s second law of motion when the
momentum changes either due to change in mass
or due to change in velocity or due to change in both
the mass and velocity.

It is observed that the mass of a particle
increases with increase in velocity but it
becomes perciptible only when the velocity v of
the particle is comparable with the speed of light c
(3 x 108 ms‘). At velocities v << c (i.e., when
v << 10° m s~'), the change in mass is not
perceptible*. At such velocities (v << c), mass m
can be considered to be constant. Then Newton’s

second law takes the form F = mov = ma.

At

Thus, for the relation F = m4” = ma to hold,
two conditions are needed : (i) when velocities
are much smaller than the velocity of light, and
(ii) when mass remains constant.

Newton’s second law is the fundamental law
of motion. The first law of motion is also included
in the second law. This we can see as follows.

To obtain Newton’s first law of motion from
second law of motion

From Newton’s second law, F = ma

If F=0, thena=0

This means that if no force is applied on the
body, its acceleration will be zero. If the body is at
rest, it will remain at rest and if it is moving, it will
remain moving in the same direction with the same
speed. Thus a body not acted upon by any external
force, does not change its state of rest or of motion.
This is the statement of Newton’s first law of motion.

* When v = 10° m s“'. m = 1-0000056 m, and when
¥= 10’ ms", m= 1-0005561 my. Here m, is the mass at v = 0.

. This is the general form of

65

Examples of second law of motion in daily life

The mathematical expression of the second
law of motion is F = Ap/At. It gives Ap = FAt,
so a given change in momentum of a body can be
brought about either by applying a large force for
a small duration or by applying a small force for
a long duration. For example, in hitting a cricket
ball by a bat, hammering a nail, hitting the ping-
pong ball by a racket, etc. a required momentum
is imparted to the body by applying a force of
large magnitude for a short duration. On the other
hand in the following examples the momentum
of a moving body is brought to zero in a large
duration so as to reduce the effect of force
exerted by the moving body.

Examples :

(1) While catching a ball, the cricketer
withdraws his hands along with the ball
Let u be the velocity of the ball of mass m when

it reaches the hands of the player catching it.

The initial momentum of ball = mu

When the cricketer stops the ball (v = 0), its
final momentum = m x 0 = 0.

Change in momentum

= final momentum -— initial momentum
= 0 — mu = — mu = mu (numerically)

Here —ve sign shows that the change in
momentum is in direction opposite to the initial
direction of motion.

If the cricketer does not pull back his hands
and stops the ball as soon it touches his hands, he
gets very little time ¢, to stop the ball. Then the
force exerted by the ball on the hands of the

Change in momentum _ mu

Time interval 7 h- But
if the cricketer pulls back his hands along
with the ball, he takes a longer time f, to stop the

ball. The force now exerted by the ball on his hands
mu

is F, = —

is F,=—

cricketer is F 1=

. Since tL>t,, therefore F,<F, or the

force exerted on the hands of cricketer by the fast
moving ball is less when he withdraws his hands.
Thus cricketer avoids the chances of injury to his
palms by withdrawing his hands alongwith the
moving ball while catching it.

(2) Athletes often lands on sand (or foam)
after taking a high jump
When an athlete lands from a height on a


--- Page 13 ---
hard floor, he may hurt his teet because his feet
come to rest almost instantenously (i.e., in a
very short interval of time), so a very large
force is exerted by the floor on his feet. On the
other hand, when he lands on sand (or foam),
his feet push the sand (or foam) for some
distance, therefore the time duration in which
his feet come to rest, increases. As a result, the
force exerted on his feet decreases and he is
saved from getting hurt.

(5) When the glass vessels tail on a hard Deor,
they break, but they do not break when
they fall on a carpet (or sand)

When a glass vessel falls from a height on a
hard floor, it comes to rest almost instantenously
(i.e., in a very short time) so the floor exerts a
large force on the vessel and it breaks. But if it
falls on a carpet (or sand), the time duration in
which the vessel comes to rest, increases and so
the carpet (or sand) exerts a less force on the
vessel and it does not break.

2. A force acts for 0-1 s on a body of mass 1-2 kg
initially at rest. The force then ceases to act and
the body moves through 2 m in the next 1-0 s.
Find the magnitude of force.

When force ceases to act, the body will move
with a constant velocity. Since it moves a
distance 2 m in 1-0 s, therefore its uniform
velocity is 2 m s~!. Thus under the influence of
force, the body acquires a velocity 2 ms“! in 0-1 s.

(D) NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

3.13 NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

Newton’s first law tells us that to bring a
change in the state of rest or in the state of motion
of an object, a force is needed i.e., a force
produces a change in velocity of the object.
Newton’s second law tells us the magnitude of
acceleration produced by the force when applied
on the object. These two laws do not explain how
does the force act on the object ? This question is
answered by the Newton’s third law, which is

Examples :

(i) Consider a book lying on a table. The
weight of the book acts vertically downwards,
but the book does not move downwards. It implies

68

that the resultant force on the book is zero, which
is possible only if the table exerts an equal upward
force on the book equal to the weight of the
book. This force on the book balances the weight
of the book.

(ii) While moving on the ground, we exert a
force by our feet to push the ground backwards,
the ground exerts a force of the same magnitude
on our feet forward which makes us to move
forward.

Explanation : In the above stated examples,
we observe that there are two objects and two
forces. In the first example, the weight of the book
acting on the table downwards is the force of
action and the force exerted by table on the book
upwards is the force of reaction. In the second
example, the force exerted by our feet on the
ground is the force of action and the force exerted
by the ground on our feet is the force of reaction.

Note : The action and reaction never act
on the same body, but they always act
simultaneously on two different bodies i.e., the
forces of interaction are always present in a pair.

Experimental demonstration of Newton’s third law

Experiment : In Fig. 3.12, the ring of a
spring balance B is attached to a hook fixed in
a wall, and then the hook of another spring
balance A is attached to the hook of the spring
balance B. Now the ring of spring balance A is
pulled. We find that both the balances show the
same reading.

Reaction Action

READING = 4 kof
Fig. 3.12 Demonstration of action and reaction

READING = 4 kof

Explanation : The spring of balance A pulls
the spring of balance B due to which we get some
reading in balance B. The same reading is seen in
balance A because the spring of balance B also
pulls the spring of balance A by the same force. The
pull on the spring B by the spring A is the action
F,, and the pull on the spring A by the spring B is
the reaction F’,,. This demonstrates that “to every
action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”
(i.e., in magnitude F,, = F,, but they are in

opposite directions) or Fag =—Fpa._ .....(3.11)

Examples of action and reaction

(1) A book on a table : When a book is placed
on a table top, the book exerts a force equal
to its weight W (action) on the table in
direction AB downwards and the table
balances it by an equal force called the
reaction R (R = W) acting upwards on the
book in direction AD . Fig. 3.13 shows these

action and reaction.

the water backwards with his oar and the

Rocket motion : In a rocket, fuel is burnt
inside the rocket and the burnt gases at high
pressure and high temperature are expelled
out of the rocket through a nozzle. Thus,
rocket exerts a force F (action) on gases to
expel them through a nozzle backwards.
The outgoing gases exert an equal and
opposite force R (reaction) on the rocket due
to which it moves in the forward direction
(Fig. 3.15).

(E) GRAVITATION

3.14 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION

Each mass particle of the universe attracts the
other mass particle. The force of attraction
between the two particles because of their masses,
is called the gravitational force of attraction. For
the magnitude of this force, Sir Issac Newton gave
a law, known as Newton’s law of gravitation.

According to Newton, the force of attraction
acting between the two particles is (i) directly
proportional to the product of their masses and
(ii) inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them. This force acts along the
line joining the two particles.

<————__— + ——>

Fig. 3.18 Gravitational force between two particles
In Fig. 3.18, let there be two particles of
masses m, and m, at a separation r. The magnitude
of force of attraction F acting between them is
F x m,m, and F « 1/r°
Combining the two relations,

where G is a constant of proportionality which
is known as gravitational constant. The value
of G remains same at all places and it is
independent of the nature of particles, temperature,
medium, etc. Therefore, it is a universal constant
and is known as universal gravitational constant.

It may be mentioned here that force is a
vector quantity, hence it is necessary to indicate

>

its direction also. The direction of force F.
on mass m, is towards m, along the line
joining the masses m, and m.,, whereas the force
=
Fn on mass m, is towards mass m, along the
same line. Both these forces are equal in magnitude,

but opposite in direction (i.e., Ff, =— F,,). Thus it
is an action-reaction force i.e., a particle exerts a
force on other particle, equal and opposite to the

71

force that the second particle exerts on the first
particle.

From eqn. (3.12), G= Sr

; newton x metre?
S.L unit of G = kilogram x kilogram
= N m?kg?

The value of G is 6-67 x 107! N m? kg.
In eqn. (3.12), if m, = 1 kg, m, = 1 kg and
r= 1m, then G = F. Thus

Gravitational constant G is numerically equal to the
magnitude of force of attraction between the two
masses each of | kg placed at a-separation of | m.

Examples : (1) The gravitational force of
attraction between two bodies of masses m, = 1 kg
and m, = 1 kg kept at a separation of r = 1 m is

(6-67x107!!)x 1x1

F = 2

(2) The gravitational force of attraction
between the moon (mass = 7-36 x 10” kg) and the
earth (mass = 5-96 x 10*4 kg), taking the distance
of moon from the earth to be 3-80 x 108 m, is

(6.67107!) x (59610 ) x (7:36 x10”)
F= (3:80x10*)?

= 6-67 x 107! N.

=2x10°N.

From the above two examples, it is clear that
the gravitational force of attraction is significant
between the heavenly bodies, but it is insignificant
between the ordinary bodies.

In fact, regarding the gravitational force, it is
important to note that the gravitational force
between the two masses :

(i) is always attractive.

(ii) is directly proportional to the product of the
masses.

(iii) is inversely proportional to the square
of separation between them, i.e. it
obeys the inverse square law. Thus, by
doubling the separation between the two
masses, the force of attraction between them
is reduced to one-fourth.

(iv) is significant between heavenly bodies, but
is insignificant between ordinary bodies
because of small magnitude of G.

Importance of the law of gravitation : Newton
used this law to explain the motion of planets around
the sun, the motion of the moon (satellite) around
the earth and the motion of a freely falling body.
3.15 FORCE DUE TO GRAVITY

According to the law of gravitation, the earth
attracts each object around it, towards its centre. The
force with which the earth attracts a body is called
the force due to gravity on the body, which can be
taken to act vertically downwards at the centre of
gravity of the body. In vertical motion near the earth
surface for height much smaller than the radius of
earth, the force of gravity on the body is assumed to
be same throughout.

The force due to gravity on a body of mass
m kept on the surface of earth of mass M and
radius R, is equal to the force of attraction
between the earth and that body. It is given as
a ..--(3.13)

Taking the mass of earth M = 5-96 x 10% kg
and the radius of earth R = 6-37 x 10° m, the
force of gravity on a body of mass m = 1 kg on
the surface of earth will be

(6-67x107!!)x(5-96x1074)x1
Sc ing—C SC BN,
(6-37x10")

Thus earth attracts a body of mass 1 kg by a
force of 9-8 N towards its centre.

Note : As earth attracts an object towards it, the
object also attracts the earth towards it by an equal force.
Since the object is free to move, it starts moving towards
the earth, but the earth because of its large inertia, does
not move towards the object.

3.16 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY

Galileo was the first scientist to study the motion
of different bodies under the force of attraction of
earth (i.e., gravity). From his experiments, Galileo
found that if bodies of different masses and sizes
(or shapes) are simultaneously made to fall in
vacuum (i.e., in absence of air)* from the same
height, they all reach the earth surface
simultaneously and with same velocity. Thus, all
bodies travel the same distance in the same interval
of time. Moreover, he found that the velocity of a
freely falling body does not remain constant, but it

* In presence of air, viscous force and force due to buoyancy
act on the body upwards. These forces depend on size, shape
and velocity of the body, so they are different in magnitude
for different bodies. Therefore downward acceleration will
not remain same (equal to g) for all bodies, so they will not
reach simultaneously.

increases at a constant rate, i.e., the motion of a
freely falling body is a uniformly accelerated
motion. This acceleration is same for all bodies. In
other words, the acceleration of a freely falling
body does not depend on the mass of the body, its
size and its shape, etc. This acceleration is called
the acceleration due to gravity. Thus

"The rate at which the velocity ofa freely falling
| body increases, is called the acceleration due to

gravity. In other words, it is the acceleration
produced in a freely falling body due‘to the
gravitational force of attraction of the earth.

The acceleration due to gravity is denoted by
the letter g. Its S.J. unit is m s~. It is a vector
quantity directed vertically downwards towards
the centre of earth.

Experimentally, it is found that the value of
acceleration due to gravity g does not remain
constant. On the earth's surface, the value of g
varies from place to place. On equator, it is sightly
less as compared to that at poles. The mean value
of g on the earth surface is 9-8 m s~. At altitudes
above the earth’s surface or at depth below the earth
surface, the value of g decreases. The value of g is
zero at the centre of earth.

Note : The value of g is different on different
planets and satellites. The value of g on moon’s surface
is nearly one-sixth the value of g on earth’s surface.

Relationship between g and G : Let g be the
acceleration due to gravity at a planet (or satellite)
of mass M and radius R. By Newton’s law of
motion, the force due to gravity on a body of mass
m on its surface will be

F = mass x acceleration due to gravity

or F=mg ..-(3.14)
By Newton’s gravitational law, this attractive force

is given by F= R ...(3.15)

or jacceleration due to gravity g = Re (3.16)

The above eqn. (3.16) relates the acceleration

Obviously the value of g on a planet (or satellite)

72


--- Page 20 ---
depends on the mass and radius of that planet
(or satellite).

Examples : (1) Taking the mass of earth
M = 5-96 x 10*4 kg and the radius of earth
R = 6-37 x 10° m, the acceleration due to gravity
at a place on the surface of earth comes out to be
(6-67 x107!!)x (5-96 x1074)

(6-37 10°)?

(2) On the surface of moon (mass M = 7-36
x 102? kg and radius R = 1-75 x 10° m), the
acceleration due to gravity at the surface of moon
is

Seanth = = 9-8 ms.

3.17 FREE FALL

In chapter 2, we have studied one dimensional
motion. The motion of a freely falling body from a
height or the motion of a body thrown vertically
upwards from the surface of earth, is the one
dimensional motion under gravity. The acceleration
of a vertically falling body is a = + g and that of a
body going vertically upwards is a = — g.

If a body falls from rest freely from a height h,
under gravity then u = 0 and acceleration a is
replaced by g (acceleration due to gravity), then
equations of motion are :

1
= 6 S earth nearly.

(i) v = gt
(i) A = ; et (3.17)
(iii) = 2gh

But if the initial velocity of fall of the body
is u, then equations of motion are :

(i) v = ut gt
(ii) ho = ut+ 58 (3.18)
(iti) v? = u2+2gh

If a body is thrown vertically up with an
initial velocity u to a height A, there will be
retardation (a = — g), then equations of motion are:

(i) v = u-gt
(ii) h = ut- + et (3.19)
(iii) v= w2-2gh

At the highest point of reach, final velocity v =0,

Zz

thus maximum height reached h, = a (from
&

equation v* = u? — 2gh) and the time taken by the body

u
to rise to the highest point ¢ = zg (from equation

v= u-— gt). The same will be the time it takes to come
back to the initial point after reaching the highest

point. So the total time of journey ft’ = 2t = 2
and the total distance travelled by the body

h'=2h, = —

3.18 MASS AND WEIGHT

The mass is a scalar quantity. Its S.I. unit is
kilogram (symbol kg). It is constant for a
given body at rest and does not change by changing
the place of the body. It is an intrinsic property. of
the body. It is measured by a physical balance (or
beam balance) because the value of g (acceleration
due to gravity) is same on both the pans. The mass
of a body increases with its velocity*, but this
change is perceptible only when the velocity of the
body v becomes more than 10° ms“! i.e., reaches
close to the speed of light c (= 3 x 108 ms“), so
for a body moving with velocity less than 10° m s“!,
its mass is taken to be constant.

(b) Weight
The weight of @ body is the force with ' which’,

the earth attracts. it. In ather-words, weight of
a body is the force of gravity on-it.

The weight is a vector quantity. Its direction
is downwards towards the centre of earth.

Unit of weight : The S.I. unit of weight is
newton (N) and the C.GS. unit is dyne where
1N = 105 dyne.
Relationship between weight and mass : The
weight of a body is related to its mass as follows :

Weight = mass x acceleration due to gravity

or W=mxg ie, Wein ie. .. (3.20)

* m=m,/ {1 — (vic)? where m, is the mass of the body at rest.


--- Page 21 ---
Note : From eqn. (3.20), the S.I. unit of
acceleration due to gravity g can also be written
“as newton per: kilogrant (or N kg} in place of
metre/second’ (orm s?), ae

Since the value of g varies from place to place,
the weight of a given body also varies from place
to place.

The gravitational unit of weight in M.K.S.
system is kilogram force (kgf) and in C.GS.
system is gram force (gf), where
lkgf = 98N

1 gf = 980 dyne
Obviously a body of mass m kg will weigh m kgf.

and

The weight of a body can be measured by a
spring balance directly in newton and also by a
physical balance in kef.

force is Hilogram force ep

gravity gm s~

g newton

Since average value of g is 9-8 ms,
1 kgf = 9-8 newton (or 9-8 N)
In C.GS. system, the gravitational unit of
force is gram force (gf).

One gram force is the force due to gravity on
a mass of 1 g.

ie., 1 gf = force due to gravity on a mass of 1 g
= mass lg x acceleration due to
gravity g cm s~*
= g dyne
Since average value of g is 980 cm s~,
1 gf = 980 dyne

Further, 1 kgf = 1000 gf

To an approximation 1 kgf is assumed
to be nearly equal to 10 N. Then 1 N = 0-1 kgf
or 100 gf. Thus one can feel a force of 1 N by
holding a mass of 100 g
