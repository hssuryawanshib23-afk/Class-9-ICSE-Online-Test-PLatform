(A) UPTHRUST AND ARCHIMEDES’ PRINCIPLE

- §.1 BUOYANCY AND UPTHRUST

When a body is partially or wholly immersed
in a liquid, an upward force acts on it. This
upward force is known as upthrust or buoyant
force. It is denoted by the symbol F,. Thus

The upward force exerted on a body by thie fliiid in

which it is submerged, is called the upthrust. or
buoyant force.

The property of liquid to exert an upward
force on a body immersed in it, is called
buoyancy. This property can be demonstrated by
the following experiments.

Exp. 1. Pushing an empty can into water : Take an
empty can. Close its mouth with an airtight stopper. Put
it in a tub filled with water. It floats with a large portion
of it above the surface of water and only a small portion
of it below the surface of water.

If we push the can into water, we feel an upward
force which opposes the push and we find it difficult to
push the can further into water. It is also noticed that as
the can is pushed more and more into water, more and
more force is needed to push the can further into water,
till it is completely immersed. When the can is fully
inside water, a constant force is still needed to keep it
stationary in that position. Now if the can is released at
this position, it is noticed that the can bounces back to
the surface and starts floating again.

Exp. 2. Pushing a cork into water : If a piece of cork is
placed on the surface of water in a tub, it floats with

nearly 2th of its volume inside water. If the cork is

pushed into water and then released, it again comes to
the surface of water and floats. If the cork is kept

immersed, our fingers experience some upward force.
The behaviour of cork is similar to that of the empty can.

Explanation : When the can or cork is put in
the tub of water, two forces act on it : (i) its weight
(i.e., the force due to gravity) W which pulls it
downwards, and (ii) the upthrust F’, due to water
which pushes the can or cork upwards. It floats in
the position when the two forces become equal in
magnitude (i.e., W = F,). Now as the can or cork
is pushed more and more inside water, the upthrust
F,, exerted by water on it increases and becomes
maximum (= F,) when it is completely immersed
in water. So when it is released, the upthrust F)
exerted by water on it being greater than its weight
W (or force due to gravity), it rises up. To keep the
can or cork immersed, an external downward force

(= F;, — W) is needed to balance the net upward
force.
Note : Like liquids, gases also have the

property of buoyancy, i.e., a body immersed (or
placed) in a gas also experiences an upthrust. All
objects including ourselves, are also acted upon
by a buoyant force due to air, but we do not feel it
because it is negligibly small as compared to our
own weight. On the other hand, a balloon filled
with hydrogen (or any gas less denser than air)
rises up because the upthrust (or buoyant force) on
balloon due to the surrounding air is more than the
weight of balloon filled with the gas.

Condition for a body to float or sink in
a fluid : When a body is immersed in a fluid,
two forces act on the body : (i) the weight W of

98


--- Page 2 ---
the body which acts vertically downwards and
(ii) the upthrust F, which acts vertically
upwards. We have noticed that the upthrust
depends on the submerged portion of the body.
It increases as the submerged portion of body
inside the fluid increases and becomes maximum
(= F;) when the body is completely immersed
inside the fluid. Fig. 5.1 shows a body held
completely immersed in a fluid with two forces
W and F >, acting on it.
F‘, (Max. upthrust)

Fig. 5.1 Forces acting on a body held immersed
inside a liquid
Depending upon the density of the fluid, the
maximum buoyant force F, can be greater than,
equal to or less than the weight W of the given
body. Whether the body will float or sink in a
fluid, depends on the relative magnitudes of forces
W and F, (buoyant force when the body is fully
immersed).
(i) If F4,> Wor F%, = W, the body will float
(it will not sink). If F’, > W, the body will
float partly immersed with only that much
part of it inside liquid, the upthrust F, due
to which becomes equal to the weight W of
body (i.e., F, = W). But if F’, = W, the
body will float with whole of it immersed
inside the liquid. Thus for a floating body,
net force acting downwards (i.e., apparent
weight) is zero.
If F, < W, the body will sink due to the net
force (W — F;,) acting on the body downwards.
If m is the mass of body, it will go down into
the liquid with an acceleration a such that
ma=W-F,or a=(W- F,)/m. Here we
have ignored the viscous force of the liquid.
Unit of upthrust : The upthrust, being a
force, is measured in newton (N) or kef.
5.2 CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF
UPTHRUST
The upthrust has the following three
characteristic properties :

(ii)

(i) Larger the volume of body submerged in a
fluid, greater is the upthrust.

(ii) For same volume inside the fluid more the
density of fluid, greater is the upthrust.

(iii) The upthrust acts on the body in upward
direction at the centre of buoyancy i.e., the
centre of gravity of the displaced fluid.

(i) Larger the volume of body submerged in

a fluid, greater is the upthrust

In the experiment of pushing an empty can or
cork into water as described above, it is
experienced that the upthrust on the body due
to water increases as more and more volume of it
is immersed into water, till it is completely
immersed. .

Similarly, when a bunch of feathers and a
pebble of same mass are allowed to fall in air,
the pebble falls faster than the bunch of feathers.
The reason is that upthrust due to air on pebble
is less than that on the bunch of feathers because
the volume of pebble is less than that of the bunch
of feathers of same mass. However in vacuum,
both the bunch of feathers and pebble will fall
together because there will be no upthrust.

(ii) For same volume inside the fluid more the

density of fluid, greater is the upthrust

If we place a piece of cork A into water and
another identical cork B into glycerine (or mercury),
we notice that the volume of cork B immersed in
glycerine (or mercury) is smaller as compared to
the volume of cork A immersed in water. The
reason is that the density of glycerine (or mercury)
is more than that of water. Now if we want to
immerse cork B in glycerine to the same extent as
cork A in water, then an additional force is needed
on cork B, to immerse it to the same level as cork
A. This shows that for same volume of a body inside
the liquid, a denser liquid exerts a greater upthrust.

(iti) The upthrust acts on the body in upward
direction at the centre of buoyancy (i.e., the
centre of gravity of the displaced liquid)

For a uniform body completely immersed
inside a liquid, the centre of buoyancy coincides

with the centre of gravity of the body (Fig. 5.1).

But if a body floats in a liquid with its part

submerged (Fig. 5.2), the centre of buoyancy B is

at the centre of gravity of the displaced liquid

(i.e., at the centre of gravity of the immersed part

99


--- Page 3 ---
Fig. 5.2 A body floating with part of it submerged

of the body) which lies below the centre of gravity
G of the entire body. The weight of the body
W acts downwards at G, while upthrust F p acts
upwards at B such that W= Fy.

5.3 REASON FOR UPTHRUST

We have read that a liquid contained in a vessel
exerts pressure at all points and in all directions.
The pressure at a point in liquid is same in all
directions (upwards, downwards and sideways). It
increases with depth inside the liquid. When a body,
say a block of area of cross section A, is immersed
in a liquid (Fig. 5.3), the pressure P, exerted upwards
on the lower face of block (which is at a greater
depth) is more than the pressure P, exerted
downwards on the upper face of block (which is at
a lesser depth). Thus there is a difference in pressure
(= P,— P,) between the lower and upper faces of
block. Since force = pressure x area, the difference
in pressures due to liquid on the two faces of
block causes a net upward force (i.e., upthrust)
=(P,—P,)A on the body. However, the thrust on the
side walls of body get neutralised as they are equal
in magnitude and opposite in directions.

Fig. 5.3 A block immersed in a liquid

Note : If a lamina (thin sheet) is immersed in a
liquid, the pressure on its both surfaces will be
nearly same, so the liquid will exert negligible
upthrust on it, causing it to sink into the liquid due
to its own weight.

5.4 UPTHRUST IS EQUAL TO THE

WEIGHT OF DISPLACED LIQUID

(Mathematical proof)

When a body is immersed in a liquid, upthrust
on it due to liquid is equal to the weight of the

liquid displaced by the submerged part of the
body.

Proof : Consider a cylindrical body PQRS
of cross-sectional area A immersed in a liquid
of density p as shown in Fig. 5.4. Let the upper
surface PQ of body be at a depth h, while its
lower surface RS be at a depth h, below the free
surface of liquid.

Fig. 5.4 Calculation for upthrust

At depth h,, pressure on the upper surface PQ

P, = hipg
.. Downward thrust on the upper surface PQ
F, = pressure x area=h,pg A ve(i)
At depth h,, pressure on the lower surface RS
P, = h,pg
. Upward thrust on the lower surface RS
F, =hpgA (11)

The horizontal thrust at various points on the
vertical sides of body get balanced because liquid
pressure is same at all points at the same depth.

From above eqns. (i) and (ii), it is clear that
F,, > F, because h, > h, and therefore, the body
will experience a net upward force.

Resultant upward thrust (or buoyant force)
on the body

F, = F,-F,
= h,pgA —h,pgA
= A(h, - h,) Pg

But A (h, —h,) = V, the volume of the body

submerged in liquid.
Upthrust F, = Vp 3 | (5.1)
Since a solid when immersed in a liquid,

displaces liquid equal to the volume of its
submerged part, therefore

Vpg = Volume of solid immersed x density of
liquid x acceleration due to gravity.

100


--- Page 4 ---
or Vpg = Volume of liquid displaced x density
of liquid x acceleration due to gravity.
= mass of liquid displaced x acceleration
due to gravity.
= Weight of the liquid displaced by the
submerged part of the body.

Hence,

(5.2)

Note : (1) If the body is completely immersed

in a liquid, the volume of liquid displaced will be

equal to its own volume and upthrust then will be
maximum (= F°3).

(2) Although the above result is derived for a
cylindrical body, but it is equally true for a body of
any shape and size.

Factors affecting the upthrust
From the above discussion, it is clear that
the magnitude of upthrust on a body due to a
liquid (or fluid) depends on the following two
factors :
(i) volume of the body submerged in liquid (or
fluid), and
(ii) density of the liquid (or fluid) in which the
body is submerged.

Effect of upthrust : The effect of upthrust is
that the weight of body immersed in a liquid
appears to be less than its actual weight. This
can be demonstrated by the following experiment.

Experiment : Lifting of a bucket full of water from a
well. Take an empty bucket and tie a long rope to it. If the
bucket is immersed in water of a well keeping one end of
rope in hand and the bucket is pulled when it is deep inside
water, we notice that it is easy to pull the bucket as long as
it is inside water, but as soon it starts coming out of the
water surface, it appears to become heavy and now more
force is needed to lift it.
This experiment shows that the bucket of water
appears lighter when it is immersed in water than its actual
weight (in air).

Similarly, when pulling a fish out of water,
it appears lighter inside water as compared to
when it is out of water.

Similarly, a body weighed by a sensitive spring
_ balance, will weigh slightly less in air than in
vacuum due to upthrust of air on the body.

5.55 ARCHIMEDES’ PRINCIPLE

When a body is immersed in a liquid, it
occupies the space, which was earlier occupied by
the liquid i.e., it displaces the liquid. The volume
of liquid displaced by the body is equal to the
volume of the submerged part of the body so the
body experiences an upthrust equal to the weight
of the liquid displaced by it.

It is the upthrust due to which a body
immersed in a liquid appears to be of weight
less than its real weight. The apparent loss in
weight is equal to the upthrust on the body. This
is called the Archimedes’ principle. Thus

Archimedes’ principle states: that when a. body
is immersed partially. or completely in‘ a ‘liquid,
it experiences an upthrust, which is equal ta
the weight of the liquid displaced by-it.

This principle applies not only to liquids, but
it applies equally well to: gases also.

5.6 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF
ARCHIMEDES’ PRINCIPLE

Archimedes’ principle can be verified by
either of the following experiments.

Expt. (1) Take two
cylinders A and B of the
same volume. The cylinder A
is solid and the cylinder B
is hollow. Suspend the two
cylinders from the left
arm of a physical balance
keeping the solid cylinder A
below the hollow cylinder B.
Then balance the beam by
keeping weights on right
arm of the balance. In this
situation, both cylinders A
and B are in air.

The solid cylinder A is
now completely immersed
into water contained in a
beaker D placed on a bench
C as shown in Fig. 5.5, taking care that the cylinder A does
not touch the sides and bottom of the beaker. It is observed
that the solid cylinder A loses weight i.e., the left arm of
the balance rises up. Obviously the loss in weight is due to
upthrust (or buoyant force) of water on the cylinder A.

Now pour water gently in the hollow cylinder B till itis
completely filled. It is observed that the beam balances again.

Thus, it is clear that the buoyant force acting
on solid cylinder A is equal to the weight of water

Fig. 5.5 Verification of
Archimedes’ principle

101


--- Page 5 ---
filled in the hollow cylinder B. Since the cylinders
A and B both have equal volume, so the weight of
water in the hollow cylinder B is just equal to the
weight of water displaced by the cylinder A. Hence
the buoyant force acting on the cylinder A is equal
to the weight of water displaced by it. Thus, it
verifies the Archimedes’ principle.

Expt. (2) : Take a solid (say, a metallic piece). Suspend
it by a thin thread from the hook of a spring balance
(Fig. 5.6(a)]. Note its weight.

(a)

MEASURING CYLINDER
Fig. 5.6 Verification of Archimedes’ principle

Now take a eureka can and fill it with water up to its
spout. Arrange a measuring cylinder below the spout of
the eureka can.

Now immerse the solid gently into water of the eureka
can. The water displaced by it gets collected in the
measuring cylinder [Fig. 5.6 (b)]. When water stops
dripping through the spout, note the weight of the solid
and the volume of water collected in the measuring
cylinder.

In Fig. 5.6, the solid weighs 300 gf in air and
200 gf when it is completely immersed in water.

The volume of water collected in the measuring
cylinder is 100 ml i.e., 100 cm?3.

Loss in weight = 300 gf — 200 gf = 100 gf (i)
Volume of water displaced = Volume of solid
= 100 cm?
Since density of water = 1 g cm™
. Weight of water displaced = 100 gf (ii)

From eqns. (i) and (ii)
Weight of water displaced = Upthrust or loss in weight.
Thus the weight of water displaced by solid is

equal to the loss in weight Of the solid. This verifies
Archimedes’ principle.

5.7 SOLID BODIES WITH DENSITY (p)
GREATER THAN DENSITY OF
LIQUID (p,) SINK WHILE WITH
DENSITY (p) LESS THAN DENSITY OF
LIQUID (p,) FLOAT

Let a body of volume V and density p be
immersed completely in a liquid of density p,.
The weight of the body acting downwards will
be W = Vpg and the maximum upthrust on the
body acting upwards will be F’, = Vp,g.
Following three cases may arise :

(i) If W > F', or Vpog > Vp,g or p > p,, the
body will sink due to net force (W — F',) acting
downwards.

(ii) If W = F’, or Vpg = Vp,g or p = p,,
the body will float and the net force on the body
is zero.

(iii) If W < F’, or Vpg < Vp.g or p < £,,
the body will float due to net force (Fi, — W)
acting upwards and only that much volume v of
the body will submerg inside the liquid due to
which upthrust F, (= vp,g) balances the weight
W. The net force on the body is zero in this
situation also.

Thus a body of density p sinks in a liquid
of density p, if p > p,, while it floats if p = p,
or p < p,. This can be demonstrated by the
following experiments.

Expt. (1) : Take an iron nail and a piece of
cork both of same mass. First place the iron nail
on the surface of water contained in a cup. The
nail sinks. It implies that the force of gravity (or
weight) on iron nail pulling it downwards is
greater than the upthrust of water on nail pushing
it upwards. Now place the piece of cork on the
surface of water. The cork floats. It means that
upthrust on cork, when fully immersed is more
than that on nail because the density of water is
more than the density of cork, while the density
of tater is less than that of iron nail.

Expt. (2) : Take few solid bodies of different
materials of known density and place them on
the surface of water. It is observed that if the

102


--- Page 6 ---
density of the material of the body is equal to or
less than the density of water (i.e., Pp = Pp, or
p </,,), it floats, implying that the upthrust on
body due to its submerged part is equal to its
own weight (i.e., F, = W). Different bodies float
on water with their different volumes inside
water. If p = p,,, the body floats with whole of its
volume inside water, while if p < p,, the body
floats with only that much volume inside water
by which the upthrust F, on body balances its
weight W. On the other hand, if the density of the
material of body is more than the density of
water (i.e., P > P,), the body sinks, because the

upthrust due to water on body is less than its
weight (i.e., F, < W).

Thus the bodies of density greater than that of
liquid, sink in it, while the bodies of average

density equal to or smaller than that of liquid,
float on it.

An empty tin can (or iron ship) floats on
water because its average density* is less than
the density of water.

* The average density of a hollow body is the ratio of
mass of the body (= mass of material of body + mass of
air enclosed) to its total volume.

1. A body weighs 200 gf in air and 190 gf when
completely immersed in water. Calculate :
(i) the loss in weight of the body in water,
(ii) the upthrust on the body.
Given : Weight of the body in air = 200 gf
Weight of the body in water = 190 gf
(i) Loss in weight of the body = 200 gf — 190 gf

= 10 gf.

(B) RELATIVE DENSITY AND ITS MEASUREMENT
BY ARCHIMEDES’ PRINCIPLE

5.8 DENSITY

If equal volumes of different substances such
as wood, iron, zinc, water, glycerine, mercury
etc., are weighed by a physical balance, we find
that their masses are different. The mass of iron
is much more than the mass of an equal volume
of wood. This is because the particles of iron are
heavier and more closely packed than those of
wood. In other words, iron is denser than wood.
In a similar manner, if we take equal masses of
cotton and lead (say, one kg each), we notice that
their volumes are different. The volume of cotton
is much larger than the volume of an equal mass
of lead. This is because the particles of lead are
closely packed, while those of cotton are very
loose. In other words, lead is denser than cotton.
Thus to explain that equal volumes of different
substances have different masses or equal masses
of different substances have different volumes,
we use a term called density. It is defined as
follows :

The density of a substance is its ris: pay cenit
volume. i.é., . ~
Density of a substance

= Volume of the substance -~~45:3)

It is a scalar quantity and is represented by
the letter p (rho) or d.

If mass of a substance is M and its volume
is V, its density is

M

Unit of density
: : Unit of mass
Unit of density = Unit of volume

In S.I. system, unit of mass is kg and
unit of volume is m°, so S.I. unit of density is
kg m~. In C.GS. system, unit of mass is g and
unit of volume is cm?, so C.GS. unit of density
is g cm™ (or gram per cubic centimetre).
Relationship between S.I. and C.GS. units

1kg 1000 g
ikem = 723 = (00cm)?
ee
= 1000 gcm
Thus

1kg nr? = 10° g cor?

or 1gcnr? = 1000 kgm"

Example : The mass of 1 cm? of iron is
7:8 g, hence the density of iron is 7-8 g cm or
7800 kg m~>. Different substances have different
densities.

Effect of temperature on density

Most of the substances expand on heating and
contract on cooling, but their mass remains
unchanged. Therefore, density of most of the
substances decreases with the increase in temperature
and increases with the decrease in temperature.

Exception : The behaviour of water is
however very different due to its uneven
expansion. Water when cooled from a high
temperature, contracts up to 4°C thereafter it
expands below 4°C up to 0°C. Thus the density
of water gradually increases when it is cooled up
to 4°C, and then starts decreasing when it is
cooled further below 4°C up to 0°C. Thus,

The density of water is maximum at 4°C,
equal to 1 g cm™ or 1000 kg m°.
5.9 RELATIVE DENSITY
[R.D. = a: - “ FOR SAME VOLUME]

mh
W MM

We have read that density of water at 4°C is
1 g cm (or 1000 kg m3). Treating it as a
standard, the density of a substance can be
compared with the density of water at 4°C and
the ratio so obtained is termed as the relative
density of that substance. Thus,

The relative density (R.D.) of a substance is
the ratio of the density of that substance to

the density of water at 4°C.

Density of substance (p,)

Le. R.D. = Density of water at °C (p,)

_ _Mass of unit volume of substance
Mass of unit volume of water at 4°C
Mass of substance (m, )
= Massof an equal volume of water at 4°C (m,,)

.. (5.6)

Thus,

Relative density of a substance is also defined
as the ratio of the mass of substance to the
mass of an equal volume of water at 4°C.

Unit of relative density : Since relative
density is a pure ratio, it has no unit. It is a
scalar quantity.

Relationship between density and relative
density : While calculating the relative density of

a substance from its density (or density from its
relative density), we note that

(i) In C.GS. system, density of water at 4°C
is 1 g cm‘, so the relative density of a
substance is equal to the numerical value
of density of that substance. Thus

Density of substance in g cm™

Density in g cm™ = R.D.

5.10 DETERMINATION OF RELATIVE
DENSITY OF A SOLID SUBSTANCE
BY ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE

We know that
Mass of the body
Mass of water (at 4°C) of volume equal
to that of the body

Using Archimedes’ principle, the mass of
water of volume equal to that of the body is
obtained by finding the mass of water displaced
by that body when it is completely immersed in
water since a body when immersed in water,
displaces water equal to its own volume.
Therefore,

R.D. =

Mass of body.
Mass of water displaced by the body

Weight of body
Weight of water displaced by the body

_ Weight of body
~ Loss in weightof the body in water (or upthrust)

R.D. =

(5.9)

Thus, to find relative density of a solid body
using Archimedes’ principle, we have to weigh
the body first in air and then in water. If the

weight of body in air is W, and in water is
W,, then

(5.10)

Note : Weight and mass are related as weight = mass
x acceleration due to gravity (Le., W = Mg). On weighing
a body with a physical balance, its mass is expressed in
kg or g, while its weight is expressed in kgf or gf.

Now we shall describe the procedure to
determine the relative density of a solid in two
cases : (i) when the solid is denser than water
and insoluble in it and (ii) when the solid is
denser than water and soluble in it.

(i) R.D. of a solid denser than water and
insoluble in it

Procedure :

(i) Suspend a piece of the given solid with a
thread from hook of the left pan of a physical
balance and find its weight W,.

(ii) Now place a wooden bridge over the left
pan of balance and place a beaker nearly two-
third filled with water on the bridge. Take care
that the bridge and beaker do not touch the pan
of balance.

(iii) Immerse the solid completely in water
such that it does not touch the walls and bottom
of beaker (Fig. 5.8) and find the weight W, of
solid in water.

(ii) R.D. of a solid denser than water and soluble

Procedure : If solid is soluble in water, instead of

water, we take a liquid of known relative density in
which solid is insoluble and it sinks in that liquid. Then

the process described above is repeated. Now

5.11 DETERMINATION OF RELATIVE
DENSITY OF A_ LIQUID BY
ARCHMEDES’ PRINCIPLE

By definition, relative density of a liquid is
given as :

Weight of a given volume of the liquid

RD.= Weight of thesame volume of water G13)

By Archimedes’ principle if a solid is
immersed in a liquid or water, it displaces the
liquid or water equal to its own volume.
Therefore the above eqn. (5.13) takes the form :

Weight of liquid displaced by a body

RD. = Weight of water displaced by the same body

Weightof thebody in air— weightof thebody in liquid
~ ‘Weightof thebody in air— weightof thebody in water
...(5.14)
Thus to find the relative density of a liquid
using Archimedes’ principle, we take a body
which is heavier than both the given liquid and
water and also insoluble in both. The body is
first weighed in air, then in liquid and then after
washing it with water and drying, it is weighed
in water. If the weight of the body in air is
W, gf, in liquid is W, gf and in water is W, gf,
then from eqn. (5.14)

W, -W,
W, -W;

RD. of liquid = . (5.15)

1. Relative density of silver is 10-5. What is the
density of silver in S.I. unit ? What
assumption do you make in your calculations.
Given, R.D. of silver = 10-5

RD. = Density of silver

Density of water
Density of silver = R.D x density of water

Assumption : Density of water = 10° kg m™®.

2. A solid weighs 50 gf in air and 44 gf when
completely immersed in water. Calculate :
(i) the upthrust,

(ii) the volume of the solid, and
(iii) the relative density of the solid.
Given, weight of solid in air W, = 50 gf and weight
of solid in water W, = 44 gf.
(i) Upthrust = loss in weight when immersed in
water = W, — W, = 50 - 44 = 6 gf
(it) Weight of water displaced = upthrust = 6 gf
Since density of water is 1 g cm™3, therefore
volume of water displaced = 6 cm?
But a solid displaces water equal to its own
volume, therefore volume of solid = 6 cm*.
Weight of solidin air

(iii) RD. of solid = ‘Weight in air — Weight in water

3. A solid weighs 30 gf in air and 26 gf when
completely immersed in a liquid of relative
density 0-8. Find : (i) the volume of solid, and
(ii) the relative density of solid.

Given, weight of solid in air W, = 30 gf and weight
of solid in liquid W, = 26 gf., R.D. of liquid = 0-8
Density of liquid = 0-8 g cm
(i) Let V be the volume of solid.
Weight of liquid displaced = Volume of liquid displaced
x density of liquid x g
= Vx 0-8 x g dyne
=Vx 08 gf .(i)
Loss in weight of the solid when immersed in liquid
. = W, - W, =30- 26 =4 gf (ii)
But the weight of liquid displaced is equal to the

(i) Volume of solid = Volume of liquid displaced

(C) FLOATATION

5.12 PRINCIPLE OF FLOATATION
We have read that when a body is immersed

in a liquid, the following two forces act on it :

(i) The weight W of body acting vertically
downwards, through the centre of gravity G
of the body. This force has a tendency to sink
the body.

(ii) The upthrust F’, of the liquid acting vertically
upwards, through the centre of buoyancy B
i.e., the centre of gravity of the displaced
liquid. The upthrust (or buoyant force) is equal
in magnitude to the weight of the liquid
displaced. This force has a tendency to make
the body float.

Fig. 5.9 shows the two forces W and F, acting
on a body floating on a liquid.

Obviously, the upthrust

F, is maximum
(=F’,) when the body is completely immersed
inside the liquid.

Depending upon whether the maximum
upthrust F’, is less than, equal to or greater than
the weight W, the body will either sink or float
in liquid. So we consider the following
three cases when (i) W > F’, (ii) W = F’, and
(iii) W < F’,.

Case (i) : When W> F’, i.e., the weight of
the body is greater than the weight of the
displaced liquid. In this case, the body will sink
as shown in Fig. 5.10. The apparent weight of
the body (i.e., the weight of body inside liquid)

as measured by a spring balance if it is attached
with the body will be (W — F’,) acting vertically
downwards. This is the case when the density p
of solid is greater than the density p, of liquid

(i.e., Pp > P,).

Fig. 5.10 The body sinks when W> Fy

Case (ii) : When W = F’, i.e, the weight
of the body is equal to the weight of the
displaced liquid. In this case, the body will float
just below the surface of liquid as shown in
Fig. 5.11. The apparent weight of body will be
zero. The density p of such a body is equal to
the density , of liquid (i.e., p = p,).

Fig. 5.11 The body floats when W = F',

Case (iii) : When W < F,, i.e., the weight
of the body is less than the weight of the liquid
displaced by it when it is held completely
immersed in the liquid. In this case, the body
floats partially above and partially below the
surface of liquid as shown in Fig. 5.12. Only that
much portion of the body gets submerged by
which the weight of displaced liquid becomes
equal to the weight of the body. In this situation,

Fig. 5.12 The body floats partially inside the liquid
when W < F}, on complete immersion

112


--- Page 16 ---
while floating, weight W acts at the centre of
gravity G of the body, while upthrust F p acts at
the centre of buoyancy B which is vertically
below G, and weight W is equal to upthrust
F, only due to the submerged part of the
body. Thus, the apparent weight of the body will
be zero in this case also. The density p of
such a body is less than the density p, of liquid
(i.2., Pp < P,).

From the above discussion, we find that for
a floating body,

Weight of body

‘= Weight of liquid displaced: by the
submerged part of body.

or W = F, wiae(5.18)

5.14 APPLICATIONS OF THE PRINCIPLE
OF FLOATATION

(i) Floatation of iron ship

An iron nail sinks in water while a ship
floats : If we place an iron nail on the surface
of water, it sinks. This is because the density of
iron is greater than that of water, so the weight
of nail is more than the upthrust of water on it.

On the other hand, ships are also made of
iron, but they do not sink. This is because the
ship is hollow and the empty space in it contains
air which makes its volume large and average
density less than that of water. Therefore, even
with a small portion of ship submerged in water,
the weight of water displaced by the submerged
part of ship becomes equal to the total weight
of ship and therefore it floats.

A loaded ship is submerged more while an
unloaded ship is less submerged : When cargo
is loaded on a sailing ship, its weight increases,
so it sinks further to displace more water till the
weight of water displaced by its submerged part
becomes equal to the weight of loaded ship. If
cargo is unloaded, the ship will rise in water till
the weight of water displaced balances the
weight of unloaded ship.

A ship begins to submerge more as it sails
from sea water to river water : The water of
river is of low density than that of a sea and the
density of water of different sea is also different.
Therefore, when a ship sails from a sea of water
of higher density to a sea of water of lower
density (or from sea water to river water), it
sinks further. The reason is that according to the
law of floatation, to balance the weight of ship,

113


--- Page 17 ---
a greater volume of water is required to be
displaced in water of lower density in river (or
sea).

Plimsoll line : Each ship has a white line
painted on its side, known as the Plimsoll line.
This line indicates the safe limit for loading the
ship in water of density 10? kg m™. A ship is not
allowed to be loaded further when its Plimsoll
line starts touching the water level, so that
when it sails in sea water of density more than
10° kg m”, only the part of it below the plimsoll
line remains submerged in water.

An unloaded ship is filled with sand at its
bottom : An unloaded ship floats with its very
small volume inside water. As a result, its centre
of gravity is higher and its equilibrium is
unstable. There is a danger that it may get blown
over on its side by strong winds. Therefore, an
unloaded ship is filled with sand (or stones),
called ballast, at its bottom. This lowers its
centre of gravity to make its equilibrium stable.

(ii) Floatation of human body

The average density of human body depends
on the proportion of its constituents like bone,
blood, muscles and fat in him as each constituent
has different density. Further, it also depends on
the amount of air in his lungs at that time. The
average density of body with empty lungs is
1-07 g cm™, while with lungs filled with air is
1-00 g cm~*. A good swimmer can float on water,
like a floating object, with his lungs filled with
air and nose and mouth projecting just above the
water surface. The weight of water displaced by
him is then nearly equal to his own weight. Thus,
he can swim with a very little effort.

It is easier for a man to swim in sea water
than in fresh (or river) water : The reason is
that due to presence of minerals (salt etc.), the
density of sea water (= 1-026 g cm73) is
more than the density of fresh (or river) water
(= 1-0 g cm”). Therefore, with a smaller portion
of the body submerged in sea water, the weight
of water displaced becomes equal to the total
weight of the body, while to displace the same
weight of fresh (or river) water, a large portion of
his body will have to be submerged in water. So
it becomes difficult to swim in river water.

In the Dead Sea, the density of water is much
more (= 1-16 g cm™), therefore, a man can easily

swim in Dead Sea with a small portion
submerged inside water so as to balance his
weight.

(iii) Floatation of submarines
A submarine is a fish shaped water-tight boat
provided with several ballast (or floatation) tanks
in its front and rear parts. Fig. 5.13 shows the
portion of a submarine to explain its floatation.
It is provided with periscopes so that the diver
could see above the water surface even when the
submarine is well inside the water.
Periscope

Ballast tank Ballast tank

Fig. 5.13 Submarine

A submarine can be made to dive into the water
or rise up to the surface of water as and when
desired. If a submarine is to dive, its ballast tanks
are filled with water so that the average density of
submarine becomes greater than the density of sea
water and the submarine dives into the water. If
submarine is to rise, water from the ballast tanks
is forced out into the sea by allowing the
compressed air to enter the tank. This makes the
average density of submarine less than that of sea
water. As a result, the weight of water displaced by
its partially small submerged part becomes equal
to the weight of submarine and hence it rises up to
the surface of water.

(iv) Floatation of iceberg

The density of ice is less than the density of
water. The density of ice is 0-917 g cm™ and that
of water is 1 g cm™?. Therefore, huge masses of ice
known as icebergs are able to float on water with
their major part inside the water surface and only
a small portion above the water surface.

Volume of iceberg above the water surface
while floating : If the total volume of an iceberg
is V and the volume of iceberg submerged is v,
then by the principle of floatation,

Weight of water displaced by the submerged
part of iceberg = Total weight of iceberg

Or v X Prater * 8 = VxXp,.%8

114


--- Page 18 ---
or

Examples : (1) An iceberg (p,, = 0-917 g cm”)
floats on water (p,,,,, = 1:0 cm73) with volume
v=0-917 Vie. 91-7% of its total volume below the
water surface or only 8-3% of its volume above the
water surface as shown in Fig. 5.14.

Fig. 5.14 Floating iceberg

(2) An iceberg (p,., = 0-917 g cm-) floats on
sea water (p = 1-026 g cm-*) with volume

water

y= 2 vy = 0-893 Vi.e., 89-3% of its total
1-026

volume submerged inside sea water and only

10:7% above sea water.

Icebergs are dangerous for ships
Icebergs being lighter than water, float on water
with their major part (nearly 90%) inside water
and only a small part (~10%) outside water.
Since portion of iceberg inside the water surface
depends upon the density of sea water, therefore
for the driver of ship, it becomes difficult to
estimate the size of iceberg. Thus an iceberg is
very dangerous for the ship as it may collide
with the ship and cause damage.

No change in level of water on melting a
floating piece of ice : When a floating piece

of ice me}ts into water, tt contracts by the
volume equal to the volume of ice piece above
the water surface while floating on it. Hence the
level of water does not change when the ice
floating on it melts.
(v) Floatation of fish

Many species of fish have an organ called
a swim bladder. It acts like the ballast (or
floatation) tank of a submarine. When a fish has
to rise up in water, it diffuses gas from its fluid
into the bladder, so its volume increases and its
average density decreases. This increases the
volume of water displaced by the fish and so
the upthrust on fish increases due to which it
rises up. When the fish has to come down, it
empties its bladder to the required extent, so its
volume decreases and density increases. Hence
upthrust on fish decreases and it sinks in water.
(vi) Rising of balloons

When a light gas like hydrogen or helium
(density much less than that of air) is filled in
a balloon, the weight of air displaced by the
inflated balloon (i.e., upthrust) becomes more
than the weight of the gas filled balloon and it
rises up.

The balloon does not rise indefinitely. The
reason is that the density of air decreases with
altitude. Therefore as the balloon gradually goes
up, the weight of the displaced air (i.e.,
upthrust) decreases. It keeps on rising as long
as the upthrust on it exceeds its weight. When
upthrust becomes equal to its weight, it stops
rising further.

1. A block of wood of volume 25 cm* floats on water
with 20 cm? of its volume immersed. Calculate :
(i) the density, and (ii) the weight of block of
wood.
Given : Volume of block V = 25 cm},
Volume immersed in water v = 20 cm?

(i) If density of wood is p g cm, then by principle
of floatation.

Weight of block of wood = Weight of water
displaced by the immersed part of block.

Vog = vx 1x (since density of water = 1 g cm™)

2. A block of iron floats on mercury. Find the
fraction of volume which remains immersed
in mercury. (Densities of iron and mercury are
7-8 g cm™ and 13-6 g cm™ respectively)

Let V be the volume of iron block and v be its
volume immersed in mercury. For floatation,

Weight of block = Weight of mercury displaced by

the immersed portion of block.
Le, Vx78x g=vx 136x g
v 7.8
or =t=—7, = 0-574
4 13.6

or v =0-574V
The fraction 0-574 of total volume will remain
immersed in mercury.

3. An iceberg floats on fresh water with a part of
it outside the water surface. Calculate the
fraction of the volume of the iceberg which is
below the water surface.

Given : density of ice = 917 kg m=, density of
fresh water = 1000 kg m=.
By the principle of floatation,

Volume of iceberg immersed Density of ice
Total volume of iceberg = Density of fresh water
917
= 1000 = 0-917

Thus 0-917" part of volume of iceberg will remain
below the water surface.
4. A block of wood floats on water with 2th of

the density of wood.

Let the volume of block be V and density of

(Here the density of water is taken as 1 g cm™>)

5. A piece of wood of volume 200 cm? and
density 0-84 g cm floats in a liquid of density
1-05 g em>.

(i) What volume of wood will remain above the
surface of liquid ?

(ii) What force must be exerted on wood to keep it
totally submerged ?

Given, V = 200 cm’, p, = 0-84 g cm™, p, = 1-05 g cm}

(i) Let V’ cm? be the volume of wood which remains
above the surface of liquid. Then submerged
volume of wood v = V— V’ = (200 - V’) cm?3
and by the principle of floatation,
Weight of wood piece

= Upthrust due to submerged part of wood

200 x 0:84 x g = (200-V’)x 105 x g
v= 200x (1-05 - 0-84)
~ 1-05
_ 200x0-21__ 3
= “ros 7 40cm

(ii) When wood piece is totally submerged, then

Upthrust = Vx p, x g=200x 1-05 xg
= 210 gf (upwards)
Weight of wood piece = Vx p, x g=200x0-84xg

168 gf (downwards)

Force to be exerted to keep the wood totally
submerged

= Upthrust — Weight of wood piece
= 210 — 168 = 42 gf.

6. The volume of a balloon is 1000 m/. It is filled
with helium of density 0-18 kg m~. What maximum
load can it lift ? Density of air is 1:29 kg m™.
Given, volume of balloon V = 1000 m3,
density of helium p = 0-18 kg m7,
density of air = 1-29 kg m=?

Weight of helium filled balloon
=Vxpx g= 1000x018 xg
= 180 gN = 180 kef
Weight of air displaced = upthrust
V x density of air x g
1000 x 1-29 x g
= 1290 g N = 1290 kef
Resultant upward force on balloon
= upthrust — weight of balloon
= 1290 — 180 = 1110 kef.
So it can lift a maximum load of 1110 kgf.

three different liquids A, B and C of densities p,,p, and
P, respectively. Which of the liquid has the highest
density ? Give reason for your answer.

Fig. 5.15

Ans. C

Reason : The upthrust on the body by each liquid is
same and it is equal to the weight of body. But

Ans.

117

upthrust = volume submerged x p, x g. For liquid C,
since volume submerged is least so density p, must
be maximum.

Draw a diagram to show the forces acting on a
body floating in water with its some part

A balloon filled with helium gas floats in a big
closed jar which is connected to an evacuating
pump. What will be your observation, if air from
jar is pumped out ? Explain your answer.

Ans. Observation : The balloon will sink.
Explanation : As air is pumped out from jar, the
density of air in jar decreases, so the upthrust on
balloon decreases. As weight of balloon exceeds the
upthrust on it, it sinks.

A block of wood is so loaded that it just floats in
water at room temperature. What change will occur
in the state of floatation, if
(a) some salt is added to water,
(b) water is heated ?
Give reason.
Ans. (a) Floats with some part outside water.

Reason : On adding some salt to water, the density
of water increases, so upthrust on block of
wood increases and hence the block rises up till
the weight of salty water displaced by the
submerged part of block becomes equal to the weight
of block. (b) Sinks.
Reason : On heating, the density of water decreases,
so upthrust on block decreases and weight of block
exceeds the upthrust due to which it sinks.
