(A) SYSTEMS OF UNIT AND UNITS IN S.I. SYSTEM

1.1 NEED OF UNIT FOR MEASUREMENT

Physics, like other branches of science
require experimental studies which involve
measurements. For the measurement of a physical
quantity, we consider a constant quantity of same
nature as a standard and then we compare the
given quantity with the standard quantity i.e. we
find the number which expresses, how many times
the standard quantity is contained in the given
physical quantity. Thus

Measurement is the process of comparison of

the given physical quantity with. the known
standard quantity of the same nature.

The standard quantity used to measure the
given physical quantity is called the unit. For
quantities of different nature, we use different units.

Unit is the quantity of a constant magnitude
which is used to measure the magnitudes of

other quantities of the same nature...

The result of measurement of a physical
quantity is expressed in terms of the following two
parameters :

(i) The unit in which the quantity is being
measured, and
(ii) The numerical value which expresses, how

many times the above selected unit is
contained in the given quantity.

Thus the magnitude of a physical quantity is
expressed as :

Examples : (i) If the length of a piece of cloth
is 10 metre, it means that the length is measured
in the unit metre and this unit is contained
10 times in the length of that piece of cloth. .

(ii) If the mass of a given quantity of sugar is
5 kilogram, it means that the mass is measured
in the unit kilogram and this unit is contained
5 times in the given quantity of sugar.

Choice of unit

To measure a physical quantity, the unit
chosen should have the following properties :

(i) The unit should be of convenient size.

(ii) It should be possible to define the unit
without ambiguity,

(iii) The unit should be reproducible.

(iv) The value of unit should not change with
space and time. (i.e., it must always remain
same everywhere).

The last three conditions (ii), (iii) and (iv) are
essential for the unit to be accepted internationally.

Kinds of unit

Units are of two kinds : (i) Fundamental or
basic units, and (ii) Derived units.


--- Page 2 ---
(i) Fundamental or basic units

A fundamental (or basic) unit is that which
is independent of any other unit or which can

neither be changed nor can be related to any
other fundamental unit.

Examples: The units of mass, length, time,
temperature, current and amount of substance are
independent of each other. They can not be
obtained from any other unit. These are the
fundamental units.

(ii) Derived units
The units of quantities other than those
measured in fundamental units, can be expressed

in terms of the fundamental units and they are
called the derived units. Thus

Derived units are. those which depe
the fundamental units or which.

sexpressed in terms of the f

Examples : (i) For the measurement of area,
we need to measure length and breadth in the unit
of length and then express area in a unit which is
length x length or (length).

(ii) The volume is expressed in a unit which is
length x length x length or (length)°.

(iii) The unit of speed of a moving body is
obtained by dividing the unit of distance (i.e., length)
by the unit of time i.e., it can be expressed in terms
of the units of length and time.

Thus the units used to measure area, volume,
speed, etc. are the derived units. More examples of
derived units are given ahead in article 1.6.

1.2 SYSTEMS OF UNIT

In mechanics, length, mass and time are the
three fundamental quantities. For the units of
these three basic quantities, following systems
have been used :

(i) C.GS. system (or French system) : In this
system, the unit of length is centimetre (cm),
of mass is gram (g) and of time is
second (s).

(ii) F.P.S. system (or British system) : In this

system, the unit of length is foot (ft), of mass
is pound (Ib) and of time is second (s).

(i11) M.K.S. system (or metric system) : In
this system, the unit of length is metre (m),
of mass is kilogram (kg) and of time is
second (s).

The above mentioned systems are now no
longer in use and are only of historical
importance. Now we use the S.I. system of units
which is an enlarged and modified version of
the metric system.

Systeme Internationale d’Unites (or S.I. system)

In 1960, the General Conference of Weights
and Measures recommended that in addition to
the units of length, mass and time, the units of
temperature, luminous intensity, current and the
amount of-substance also be taken as fundamental
units and the units of angle and solid angle as the
complementary fundamental units. Thus in all,
now there are seven fundamental units and two
complementary fundamental units.

For S.I. system, the following table gives the
fundamental quantities, their units and their
standard symbols.

Fundamental quantities, units and symbols
in S.I. system

Use of prefix with a unit

For expressing large measurements, we
use deca, hecto, kilo etc., as prefixes with the units.

The various small measurements are expressed
by using the prefixes deci, centi, milli, micro, etc.,
with the units. The symbol and meaning of each
such prefix are given below.

Some prefixes used for small measurements

Example : 2-5 GHz will mean 2-5 x 10° Hz,
5-0 pF will mean 5-0 x 10-!? F, 5-0 MQ will mean
5-0 x 10° Q, 2-0 ms will mean 2:0 x 10 s and so on.
1.3 UNITS OF LENGTH

S.I. unit of length

The S.I. unit of the length is metre (m).
A metre was originally defined in 1889 as the
distance between two marks drawn on a
platinum-iridium (an alloy with 90% platinum
and 10% iridium) rod kept at '0°C in the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures
at Sevres near Paris.

Later, in 1960, the metre was re-defined as
1,650,763-73 times the wavelength of a specified
orange-red spectral line in the emission spectrum

of Krypton-86. It is also defined as : ‘one metre

3

is 1,553,164-1 times the wavelength of the red
line in the emission spectrum of cadmium’.

In 1983, the metre was re-defined in terns’ off

speed of light according to which one metre

is the distance travelled by the light! ine

799,792,458 2 2 second in air (or vacuum).

Sub units of metre

For the measurement of small lengths, the
metre is considered too big a unit. The most
commonly used sub units of metre are
(i) centimetre (cm), (ii) millimetre (mm),
(iii) micron (1) and (iv) nanometre (nm).
(i) centimetre (cm) : One centimetre is one-
hundredth part of a metre. i.e.,

192
100 ™ = 10°“ m

(ii) millimetre (mm) : One millimetre is one-
thousandth part of a metre. i.e.,

lcm=

1 igs e
1009 @ = 10° m= jo cm

(iii) micrometre or micron ; /t is one-millionth

(10) part of a metre. It is expressed by the

symbol p. It is also called micrometre (symbol pm).
1 micron (1) = 10 metre

104 cm = 107 mm

It is one billionth

10°? m

1 mm =

(iv) nanometer (nm) :
(10~° th) part of a metre. i.e., 1 nm =
Multiple units of metre

For the measurement of large lengths (or
distances), the metre is considered as too small
a unit. The most commonly used multiple unit
of metre is kilometre.
kilometre (km) : One kilometre is the one-
thousand multiple of a metre. i.e.,

1 km = 1000 m (or 103 m).

Non-metric units of length

Bigger units : For the measurement of
distance between two heavenly bodies, the kilometre
is considered a too small unit. The commonly used
units for this purpose are : (i) astronomical unit
(A.U.), (ii) light year (ly) and (iii) parsec.
(i) Astronomical unit (A.U.) : One astronomical
unit is equal to the mean distance between the
earth and the sun. i.e.,

LAU. = 1-496 x 10! metre



--- Page 4 ---
(ii) Light year (ly) : A light year is the distance
travelled by light in vacuum, in one year. i.e.,
1 light year = speed of light x time 1 year
=3x 108 ms"! x (365 x 24 x 60 x 60s)
= 946 x 10'5 m = 9-46 x 10!2 km
The distance of stars from earth is generally
expressed in light years. However, light minute and
light second are its smaller units.

1 light minute =3 x 108 ms x 60s = 1-8 x 10!°m
and 1 light second =3 x 108 ms"! x 1s =3 x 108m
(iii) Parsec : One parsec* is the distance from
where the semi major axis of orbit of earth (1 A.U.)
subtends an angle of one second.

ie., Parasec x 1 = 1 ALU.

_ 1-496 x 10! m 16
or 1 Parasec = (1/3600) x (7/180) = 3-08 x 10’°m
3.08x10!°
= ————~ ly =3-261
9.46x10 ~ y

Smaller units : To express the wavelength of
light, size and separation between two molecules
(or atoms), radius of orbit of electron, etc. a small
size unit called the Angstrom (A) is used, while
the size of the nucleus is expressed by a still smaller
unit called fermi (f).

(i) Angstrom (A ) : It is 10-!°th part of a metre.
It is expressed by the symbol A. ice.,

1 Angstrom (A) = 10-!° metre
= 10%cm=10'7' nm
. Imicron = 10,000 A
and Inm = 10A

Nowadays, A is outdated and nm is preferred over
the A. The wavelength of light, inter-atomic or
inter-molecular separation, etc. are now commonly
expressed in nm.
(ii) fermi (f) : It is 10-'> th part of a metre. i.e.,
1 fermi (f) = 10-5 m

The commonly used smaller and bigger units

of length are summarized in the following table.
Smaller and bigger units f jength

* Parsec is constituted from the combination of two
words, parallax (par) and arc-second (sec).

The mass of 6-02 x 107° atoms of carbon
12 kg*.

* Avogadro number N = 6-02 x 10°° per kg atom.

1.4 UNITS OF MASS
S.L. unit of mass
The S.I. unit of mass is s Kilogram (kg).

However, the mass of 1 litre (= 1000 ml) of
water at 4°C is also taken as 1 kilogram.

Sub units of kilogram
For measurement of small masses,
kilogram (kg) is a bigger unit of mass.
The smaller units of mass in common use are
(i) gram (g) and (ii) milligram (mg).
(i) gram (g) : One gram is the one-thousandth
part of a kilogram i.e.,
1 -
18 = 7009 ke=10 3 kg
or lkg =1000¢
(ii) milligram (mg) : One milligram is
one-millionth (10) part of a kilogram or it is
one-thousandth (1073) part of a gram. ie.,

Img=10%kg or Img=10%g

Multiple units of kilogram

The bigger common units of mass used in
daily life are (i) quintal and (ii) metric tonne.

(i) quintal : It is one hundred times a kilogram,
= 100 kg

It is one-thousand times a

Le., 1 quintal
(ii) metric tonne :
kilogram. i.e,

1 metric tonne = 1000 kg = 10 quintal.

Non-metric unit of mass

The mass of atomic particles such as proton,
neutron and electron is expressed in a unit called
the atomic mass unit (symbol a.m.u) or the
unified atomic mass unit (symbol u). It is

defined as below :

-12 is


--- Page 5 ---
. Lamu (or u) = 75 602x10 kg

= 1-66 x 10-27 kg
The mass of large heavenly bodies is
measured in terms of solar mass where | solar
mass is the mass of the sun, i.e.,
1 solar mass = 2 x 10” kg

The commonly used smaller and bigger units
of mass are summarized in the following table.
Smaller and bigger units of mass

1.5 UNITS OF TIME
S.I. unit of time
The S.I. unit of time is second (s).

A second is defined as: 1/8
a mean solar day. ke.,

1s=

x one mean. olar-ilay

One solar day j is the time taken by the earth
to complete one rotation on its own axis.

For many years, the above definition of
second remained in use. But mean solar day
varies over the years, therefore in 1956, scientists
agreed to consider one year 1900 and 12 hours
as the ephemeris time and one year 1900 to be
equal to 365-2422 days. Thus,

1 year 1900 = 365-2422 days
= 365-2422 x 86400 s
= 31556925-9747 s
Hence one second is defined as

| .
31556925-9747 th part of the year 1900. i.e.,

]
1 S= 37 556,925.9747 th part of the year 1900.

In 1964, a second was defined in terms of
energy change in cesium atom as follows :

-One:second is the time interval of 9398881,770
vibrations: of radiation: a
the ground state of the ¢ cesium - - 133 atom.

1 Smaller units of time ,

The common smaller units of time are
millisecond (ms), microsecond (js), shake and
nanosecond (ns) where

I1ms=107%s; 1 ps=10%s;
1 shake = 10° s and 1 ns = 10°’ s.

Bigger units of time

Sometimes second is a smaller unit of time
and so we use other units of time such as
(i) minute, (ii) hour, (iii) day, (iv) month,
(v) lunar month, (vi) year, (vii) leap year,
(viii) decade, (ix) century and (x) millennium.
They are defined as below.

: One minute is the duration
1 min = 60s

(i) minute (min)
of 60 second. i.e.,

(ii) hour (h) :
60 minutes. i.e.,
1h = 60 min

= 60 x 60 s = 3600 s
(iii) day : The time taken by the earth to rotate
once on its own axis is called a day. One day is
divided in 24 hours. Thus,

I day =24h

= 24 x 60 min = 1440 min

= 24 x 60 x 60 s = 86400 s
(iv) month : The western or Gregorian Calendar
has January, March, May, July, August, October
and December each of 31 days; April, June,
September and November: each of 30 days and
Feburary of 28 days (or 29 days in a leap year). To
an approximation, a month is considered to be of
30 days and a year of 12 months to be of 365 days.
(v) lunar month : The western or Gregorian
Calendar is based on the period of revolution of
earth around the sun, but our Hindu (Vikram and
Shak) and Muslim (Hizri) Calendars are based on
the phases of moon as seen from our earth. In these
calendars, one month is the time of one lunar cycle
which is nearly 29.5 days. The period of 12 lunar
months is 354-37 days.
(vi) year (yr) : One year is defined as the time in
which the earth completes one revolution around
the sun. The period of revolution of earth around
the sun is nearly 365 days. Thus,

lyr = 365 days
= 365 x 86400 s = 3-1536 x 10’ s

One hour is the duration of



--- Page 6 ---
(vii) Leap year : A leap year is the year in which
the month of February is of 29 days, i.e.,
1 Leap year = 366 days
Since the exact period of revolution of the
earth around the sun is 365-2422 days, therefore
to compensate for the excess of 0-2422 days in a
year, the English calendar has been modified as
follows :
Every fourth year (i.e., the year divisible by
4) has one day extra in the month of
February (i.e., the February then has
29 days) and so it is the leap year. For
example, the years like 1904, 1908,
2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, were the leap years
and the years 2016, 2020, .... will also be
the leap years. The exception is :
The century years (i.e., 1800, 1900 etc.)
though divisible by 4, are not the leap years
e.g. the year 2100 will not be a leap year.
But the years which are divisible by 400,
will be the leap year. e.g. the year 2000 was
a leap year and the year 2400 will also be
a leap year.
(viii) Decade : A decade is of 10 years. Thus,
1 Decade = 10 years = 3-1536 x 108 s

(ix) Century : A century is of 100 years. In a
century, there will be 24 years each of 366 days

and 76 years each of 365 days. Thus,
1 Century = 100 years

= (24 x 366 + 76 x 365) days

= 36524 days = 3-16 x 10°s.

(x) Millennium : A millennium is of 1000 years,

ie. 1 Millennium = 3-16 x 10! s

The commonly used bigger units of time are
summarized in the following table.

SOME EXAMPLES OF DERIVED UNITS

We have read that apart from the seven
fundamental quantities used in S.I. system
such as length, mass, time, temperature, luminous
intensity, current and the amount of substance,
the units of all other physical quantities are
obtained in terms of the fundamental units. The
units so obtained are called the derived units.
Some examples of derived units are listed below.

From the above list, it can be noted that some derived units are complex when they are expressed in
terms of fundamental units. Such derived units have been given special names after the name of the scientist
who has contributed in that field. For example, newton for force, joule for work (or energy),watt for power,
pascal for pressure, hertz for frequency, coulomb for electric charge, volt for electric potential (or e.mf.)
and ohm for electrical resistance. Full name of such a unit is always written with small initial letter, while

its symbol is written with the first capital letter.

1.7 GUIDELINES FOR WRITING THE UNITS is always written with a lower initial letter e.g.,
unit for mass is written as kilogram, not as
Kilogram; unit of length is written as metre,
not as Metre; unit of force is written as newton

Conventionally following rules are observed
while writing the unit of a physical quantity :

(i) The symbol for a unit, which is not named and not as Newton ; unit of energy is written
after a scientist, is written in small letter. as joule and not as Joule; unit of power iS
For example, symbol for metre is m, for written as watt and not as Watt.

d is s, for kil is kg and so on. . ‘plicat;
Secone Is 8, Tor Kilogram Is Kg and’ so on (iv) A compound unit formed by multiplication

(ii) The symbol for a unit, which is named after of two or more units is written after putting
a scientist, is written with first letter of his a dot, cross or leaving a space between the
name in capital. For example, N for newton, two symbols. For example, the unit of torque

hertz, C fe lomb and V fe It. . . .

(iii) The full name of the unit, irrespective of the which are formed by dividing one unit by
fact whether it is named after a scientist or not, the other.

(vi) A unit in its short form is never written in the prefix and symbol combined becomes the
plural. For example, 10 metres can not be new symbol of the unit. For example, km?
written as 10 ms, because ms would mean means (103 m)? = 10° m3; it does not mean

millisecond. 10? m3.

(B) MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH

1.8 LEAST COUNT OF A MEASURING
INSTRUMENT

The measurement of a physical quantity (such
as length, mass, time, current, etc.), requires an
instrument. For example, a metre rule (or vernier
callipers) is used for length, a balance for mass, a
watch for time, a thermometer for temperature and
an ammeter for current. Each instrument has a definite
limit for accuracy of measurement which is expressed
in terms of its least count.

The least count of an instrument is the
smallest measurement that can be taken
A measuring instrument is provided with a

graduated scale for measurement and the least count
is the value of one smallest division on its scale. For
example, the least count of a metre rule is the value
of its one division which is one-tenth of a centimetre
(or 1 mm). The least count of a stop watch is
0-5 second if there are 10 divisions between 0 and
5 s mark. The least count of an ammeter having
5 divisions between the marks 0 and 1 A, is 0-2 A.

Smaller the least count of an instrument, more
precise is the measurement made by using it.
1.9 MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH

Generally a metre rule having its zero mark at
one end and 100 cm mark at the other end is used to
measure the length of an object. It has 10 subdivisions
in each one centimetre length, so the value of its one
small division is 1 mm (or 0-1 cm). Thus a metre rule
can be used to measure length correct only up to
1 mm i.e., one decimal place of a centimetre. It cannot
measure length with still more accuracy i.e., up to
second decimal place of a centimetre. The reason is
that if one end of object lies between two small
divisions on metre rule, the mark nearer the end of
the object is read and thus its length correct up to the
second decimal point can not be measured. However
it becomes possible with the help of the vernier

10

callipers and screw gauge. They are more accurate
since they have least count smaller than 0-1 cm.

1.10 PRINCIPLE OF VERNIER

Pierre Vernier devised a method by which length
up to 2nd decimal place of a cm i.e.,correct up to
0-1 mm (or 0-01 cm) can be measured. In this
technique, two scales are used. One scale, called the
main scale, is fixed, while the other scale, called the
vernier scale, slides along the main scale.

The main scale is graduated with value of one
division on it equal to 1 mm. The graduations on the
vernier scale are such that the length of
n divisions on vernier scale is equal to the length of
(n — 1) divisions of the main scale. Generally, a
vernier scale has 10 divisions and the total
length of these 10 divisions is equal to the length of
10 — 1 = 9 divisions of the main scale i.e., equal to
9 mm. Thus each division of the vernier scale is of

length 0-9 mm (i.e., smaller in size by 7 mm than a

division on the main scale). This difference is utilised
as least count for the measurement.

Least count of vernier or vernier constant

The least count of vernier is equal to the
difference between the values of one main scale
division and one vernier scale division. It 1s also
called the vernier constant. Thus,

Vernier constant or least count of vernier,
L.C. = value of 1 main scale division
~ value of-1 vernier scale division.

A E.1)
Let n divisions on vernier be of length equal
to that of (mn — 1) divisions on main scale and the
value of 1 main scale division be x. Then
Value of n divisions on vernier = (n — 1)x

Value of 1 division on vernier = falk

(1.2)
Thus, the least count of a vernier is obtained
simply by dividing the value of one division of main
scale by the total number of divisions on vernier
scale.
Example : Fig. 1.1 shows a main scale graduated
to read up to 1 mm and a vernier scale on which
the length of 10 divisions is equal to the length of
9 divisions on main scale. We are to find its least
count.

Use of vernier scale

Fig. 1.2 illustrates the use of a vernier scale. The
two scales (main scale and vernier scale) are so made
that when the movable vernier scale touches the
jixed end, its zero mark coincides with the zero mark
of the main scale. The rod whose length is to be
measured, is placed along the main scale and vernier
scale is moved so as to hold the rod between the
fixed end and the movable vernier scale. In this
position, the zero mark of the vernier scale is ahead
of 1-2 cm mark on main scale. Thus the actual length
of the rod = 1-2 cm + the length ab (i.e., the length
between the 1-2 cm mark on main scale and 0 mark
on vernier scale). The length ab cannot be measured

Hence from eqn. (1.1), : main = as its om 1S = = one

division marked on the main scale.

To measure the length ab, first we find the least
count of the vernier scale. It is Ol om = 0-01 cm.
Then we note that p™ division of vernier scale which
coincides (or which is in line) with any
division of the main scale. The product of this number

of vernier division p with the least count gives the length
ab.* This is called the vernier reading. Thus

length ab = vernier reading = p x least count,
and Total reading = main scale reading

+ vernier reading
..(1.3)

In Fig. 1.2, the main scale reading is 1-2 cm and
4th division of vernier scale coincides with a
main scale division and so the length ab (or vernier
reading) is 4 x 0-01 cm = 0-04 cm.

Hence the length of rod is 1-2 + 0-04 = 1-24. cm.

1.11 VERNIER CALLIPERS

A vernier callipers is also called the slide
callipers. It is used to measure the length of a rod,
the diameter of a sphere, the internal and external
diameters of a hollow cylinder, the depth of a small
beaker (or bottle), etc.

(a) Description

A vernier callipers is shown in Fig. 1.3. It consists
of a long and thin steel strip provided with a jaw J,
at one end. On the strip, a scale is graduated with the
value of one division equal to 1 mm. This is the main
scale. Another small steel strip provided with a jaw
J, at its end, can slide over the main scale strip. This
strip also has a scale graduated with 10 divisions on
it, the length of which is equal to 9 mm. It is called
the vernier scale. For more precise measurement, the
vernier scale can have 20, 25 or 50 divisions marked
on it and the total length of vernier divisions will be
equal to the length of one division less (i.e., 19, 24 or
49 divisions respectively) on the main scale. The
vernier scale which slides over the main scale, can

be fixed at any position on the main scale with the

other and are projected on either side of the main
scale to hold the given object. The lower jaws are
called the outside jaws and they are used to measure
the length of a rod, diameter of a sphere or external
diameter of a cylinder. The upper jaws are called the
inside jaws which are used to measure the internal
diameter of a hollow cylinder (or pipe).

A vernier callipers is also provided with a thin
and long strip 7 attached to the vernier scale strip, at
the back of the main scale strip. It slides with the
vernier scale. When jaws J, and J, are in contact, the
end of the strip T touches the end at the back of the
main scale strip. The strip T is used to measure the
depth of a small beaker (or bottle).

(b) Least count of vernier callipers
The least count of vernier callipers is equal to

the difference between the values of one main scale

division and one vernier scale division. It is

calculated by using the eqn. (1.2), ie.,

Value of one main scale division (x)

Total number of divisions on vernier (7)

LC. =

12

The least count of a vernier callipers can be
decreased by (i) increasing the number of divisions
on the vernier scale and (ii) decreasing the value of
one division on main scale.

(c) Zero error in vernier callipers

On bringing the movable jaw J, in contact
with the fixed jaw J,, the zero mark of the vernier
scale should coincide with the zero mark of the main
scale. If it is so, the vernier is said to be free from
zero error. In this condition, the end of strip T also
touches the end of the main scale strip.

But sometimes there is a mechanical error in the
vernier callipers due to which the zero mark of the
vernier scale does not coincide with the zero mark of
the main scale when the two jaws J, and J, are in
contact. It is then said to have zero error. In such a
case, the zero error is equal to the length between
the zero mark of the main scale and the zero mark of
the vernier scale. It is necessary to account for this
error for a correct (or true) measurement from this
instrument.

Kinds of zero error : The zero error is of the
following two kinds :

(i) Positive zero error, and
(ii) Negative zero error.

(i) Positive zero error : On bringing
the two jaws together, if zero mark of the vernier
scale is on the right of zero mark of the main scale,
the zero error is said to be positive. Fig. 1.4 shows
the two scales of a vernier callipers with positive zero
error. The positive zero error is equal to the length
between the zero mark of the vernier scale from the
zero mark of the main scale.

To find this error, we note that division of the
vernier scale which coincides with any division of
the main scale. The number of this vernier division
when multiplied by the least count of the vernier,
gives the zero error.

For example, for the scales shown in Fig. 1.4,
the least count is 0-01 cm and the 6" division of

(ii) Negative zero error : On bringing the two
jaws together, if zero mark of the vernier
scale is to the left of zero mark of the main scale,
the zero error is said to be negative. Fig. 1.5 shows
the two scales of a vernier callipers with
negative zero error. The negative zero error is
equal to the length between the zero mark of the
main scale from the zero mark of the vernier scale.

MAIN SCALE COINCIDING DIVISION

Je
Fig. 1.5 Negative zero error

To find this error, we note that division of the
vernier scale which coincides with any division of
the main scale. The number of this vernier division
is subtracted from the total number of divisions on
the vernier scale and then the difference is multiplied
by the least count.

In Fig. 1.5, the least count is 0-01 cm and the
sixth division of the vernier scale coincides with a
certain division of the main scale. The total number
of divisions on vernier are 10.

Zero error = — (10-6) x L.C.

= —-4x0-01 cm = —0-04 cm.
(d) Correction due to zero error i.e., correct
measurement with a vernier callipers having

a zero error

To get the correct reading, the zero error with
its proper sign is always subtracted from the
observed reading. i.e.,

Thus the positive zero error gets subtracted from
the observed reading, while the negative zero error
gets added to the observed reading.

(e) Measurement of length of an object with a
vernier callipers
Procedure :
(i) Find the least count and zero error of the vernier
callipers.
(ii) Move the jaw J, away from the jaw J, and

jaws J, and J,. Move the jaw J, towards the
jaw J, till it touches the object. Tighten the
screw ‘s to fix the vernier scale in its position.

(iii) Note the main scale reading.

(iv) Note that division p on vernier scale which
coincides or is in line with any division of the
main scale. Multiply this vernier division p with
the least count. This is the vernier scale reading
i.e., Vernier scale reading = p x L.C.

(v) Add the vernier scale reading to the main scale
reading. This gives the observed length.

(vi) Repeat it two times and record the observations
as below.

Observations :

From the mean observed length, subtract the zero
error, it any, with its proper sign to obtain the true
measurement of the length of the given object. Thus,
Observed length = main scale reading + (vernier
scale) x least count.

True length = observed length — zero error (with sign)

If the vernier callipers is free from zero error, then

1.12 PRINCIPLE OF A SCREW

An ordinary screw has threads on it at an equal
distance along its length. On rotating the head of the
screw, it moves forward or backward linearly along
its axis. The linear distance which the screw moves
in one round, is equal to the distance between the
two consecutive threads on it. This distance is called
the pitch of the screw. Thus,

Generally, the pitch of a screw is 1 mm or
0-5 mm.

To use the linear movement of a screw for
measuring small lengths, the head of the screw is
made large and it is graduated along its
circumference. Normally it has 50 or 100 equal
divisions on it. This is called the circular or head
scale.

Least count of a screw

If pitch of a screw is 1 mm, and it has
100 divisions on its head, then on rotation of
100 divisions of its circular scale, the pointed end
of the screw moves by a distance equal to
1 mm. Hence the distance moved by the screw
along its axis, on rotation of 1 division of the

. 1mm
circular scale will be 100 = 0-01 mm

= 0-001 cm. This is the least distance which can
be measured by the movement of screw and is
therefore called its least count. Thus,

The least count of a screw can be obtained by
dividing the pitch of the screw by the total number
of divisions on its circular scale. ie.,

¥

Examples :

(1) If.ascrew moves by 1 mm in one rotation and it
has 100 divisions on its circular scale, then pitch
of the screw = 1 mm and least count of the

lmm
screw = 799 = 0-01 mm = 0-001 cm.

If a screw moves by 1 mm in two rotations
and its circular scale has 50 divisions,
then pitch of the screw = | nm (or 0-5 mm)

2
and the least count of the screw = “am

= 0-01 mm = 0-001 cm.

1.13 SCREW GAUGE

A screw gauge works on the principle of a
screw. It is used to measure the diameter of a wire
or thickness of a paper, etc., usually up to an
accuracy of third decimal place of a cm (ie., correct
up to 0-001 cm). However, the least count of a
micrometer screw gauge is | p (or 00001 cm).

(a) Description

A screw gauge is shown in Fig. 1.7. It has a
U-shaped frame with a flat end A called the stud at
one end and a nut N with a cylindrical sleeve at the
other end. Both the nut and sleeve are threaded from
inside. A screw with its one flat end B can be moved
inside the nut N by rotating its head which is in
form of a hollow cylinder (or thimble) provided at

the other end of the screw. A reference line or base
line graduated in mm is drawn on the cylindrical
sleeve, parallel to the axis of the screw. This is the
main scale. The hollow cylinder (or thimble) is also
graduated and it is divided into 100 equal parts. This
is the circular scale (or head scale). The thimble is
attached with a ratchet by a spring. The screw is
always rotated by turning the ratchet. As soon as the
flat end B of the screw comes in contact either with
the stud A or with the object in between A and B,
any further rotation of the ratchet does not move the
screw liriearly to press B against A (or the object).
Thus a ratchet helps in holding the given object
gently between the stud A and the end B of the
screw.

The table below gives the main parts of a
screw gauge and their functions.

Screw gauge — main parts and their functions

1. Ratchet

2. Sleeve

3. Thimble
4. Main scale

5. Circular scale

The pitch of a screw gauge is the linear distance
moved by its screw on the main scale when the
circular scale is given one complete rotation.

However, the least count of a screw gauge is
the linear distance moved by its screw along the
main scale when the circular scale is rotated by
one division on it. Thus,

Way to decrease the least count of a screw
gauge : The least count of a screw gauge can be
decreased by (i) decreasing the pitch and

(ii) increasing the total number of divisions on the
circular scale. In Fig. 1.8, a screw gauge is designed
to have 20 divisions in 1 cm on main scale and 500
divisions on its circular scale. Thus the value of one

1
division on main scale is 20 em = 0-05 cm or

0-5 mm. The screw moves | division along the main
scale in one complete rotation of circular scale so its
0-5 mm
500

= 0-001 mm or 10% m. Therefore it is called the
micrometer screw gauge. Such a screw gauge is used
where high degree of accuracy is required e.g. in
optical measurements.

(c) Zero error in a screw gauge

On bringing the flat end B of the screw in contact
with the stud A, if the zero mark of circular scale
coincides with the base line of main scale, the screw
gauge is said to be free from zero error.

But sometimes, due to mechanical error, on
bringing the stud A in contact with the stud B, the
zero mark of the circular scale is either below or
above the base line of main scale, then the screw
gauge is said to have a zero error.

Kinds of zero error : The zero error is of the
following two kinds :

(i) Positive zero error, and (ii) Negative zero error.

(i) Positive zero error : If on bringing the flat
end B of the screw in contact with the stud A, the zero
mark on the circular scale is below the base line of
main scale, the zero error is said to be positive.
Fig. 1.9 shows the position of two scales of a screw
gauge with positive zero error. To find it, we note
that division of the circular
scale which coincides with
the base line. This number
when multiplied with the least
count of the screw gauge,
gives the value of positive
zero error.

Fig. 1.9 Positive
zero error


--- Page 16 ---
In Fig. 1.9, the 5" division of circular scale
coincides with the base line. If the least count
of the screw gauge is 0°001 cm, then zero error
=+5 x 0-001 cm = + 0:005 cm.

(ii) Negative zero error : If on bringing the
flat end B of the screw in contact with the stud A,
the zero mark on the circular scale is above the
base line of main scale, the zero error is said to
be negative. Fig. 1.10 shows the position of two
scales of a screw gauge with negative zero error.
To find it, we note the division of the circular scale
coinciding with the base line. This number is
subtracted from the total
number of divisions on the
circular scale and is then
multiplied with the least
count of the screw gauge.
This gives the value of
negative zero error.

Fig. 1.10 Negative
zero error

In Fig. 1.10, 95" division of circular scale
coincides with the base line and total number of
divisions on the circular scale are 100. If least
count of the screw gauge is 0-001 cm, then zero error
=— (100 — 95) x 0:001 cm = — 0:005 cm.

(d) Correction due to zero error i.e., correct reading
with a screw gauge having a zero error

To find the correct reading, the zero error with
its sign is subtracted from the observed reading.
Thus,

(e) Measurement of diameter of a wire with a
screw gauge

Procedure :
(i) Find the least count and the zero error of the
screw gauge.
Turn the ratchet anticlockwise so as to obtain
a gap between the stud A and the flat end B.
Place the wire in the gap between the stud A
and the flat end B. Then turn the ratchet
clockwise so as to hold the given wire gently
between the stud A and the flat end B of the
screw.
Note the main scale reading.
Note that division p of the circular scale
which coincides with the base line of the main
scale. This circular scale division p when
multiplied by the least count, gives the circular
scale reading i.e.,

Circular scale reading = p x L.C.

Add the circular scale reading to the main
scale reading to obtain the total reading (i.e.,
the observed diameter of the wire).
Repeat it by keeping the wire in perpendicular
direction. Take two more observations at
different places of wire and record them in
the table below.

From the observed mean diameter, subtract the

The least count of

Main scale reading = 2 mm = 0-2 cm.
56" division of circular scale coincides with the
base line ie., p = 56
.. Circular scale reading = 56 x 0-001 cm
= 0056 cm.

Hence, observed reading = 0-2 cm + 0056 cm.
= 0:256 cm.

If the screw gauge is free from zero error, then
true reading = 0-256 cm.

(f) Backlash error

Sometimes due to wear and tear of threads of
screw, it is observed that on reversing the direction
of rotation of the thimble, the tip of the screw does
not start moving in the opposite direction at once,
but it remains stationary for a part of rotation. This
causes error in the observation which is called the
backlash error.

To avoid the backlash error, while taking the
measurements, the screw should be rotated in one
direction only. If it is required to change the
direction of rotation of the screw, do not change the
direction of rotation at once. Move the screw still
further, stop there for a while and then rotate it in
the reverse direction.

(C) MEASUREMENT OF TIME AND SIMPLE PENDULUM

1.14 MEASUREMENT OF TIME

In offices and home, we commonly use a
pendulum clock to note time which is based on the
periodic oscillations of a pendulum. Here we shall
study the principle of a simple pendulum.

Simple pendulum

A simple pendulum is a heavy point mass
(known as bob) suspended from a rigid support
by a massless and inextensible string. This is an
ideal case because we cannot have a heavy mass
having the size of a point and a string which has
no mass. Fig. 1.16 shows a simple pendulum.
Here a heavy solid (iron or brass) ball is
suspended by a light, but strong thread from a
rigid support. The ball is called the bob. In
Fig. 1.16, the rest (or mean) position of bob is O.

; SUPPORT

<7"

When the bob from its mean position O is
pulled to one side and then released, the pendulum
is set in motion and the bob moves alternately on
either side of its mean position.

Note : The pendulum used in a clock is not a
simple pendulum, but it is a compound pendulum
(i.e., a body capable of oscillating about a horizontal
axis passing through it).

(i) Some terms related to simple pendulum

Oscillation : One complete to and fro motion
of the bob of pendulum is called one oscillation.
For example in a simple pendulum shown in
Fig. 1.16, the rest (or mean) position of bob is O,
while its extreme positions on left and right sides
are A and B respectively. One oscillation is the

21

motion of the bob from O to A, A to B and then
back from B to O as shown by arrows in Fig. 1.16.
The motion of bob from A to B and then back
from 8 to A also represent one oscillation.

Period of oscillation or time period :
This is the time taken to complete one oscillation.
It is denoted by the symbol 7. Its unit is
second (s).

Frequency of oscillation : /t is the number
of oscillations made in one second. It is denoted
by the letter f or n. Its unit is per second (s"!) or
hertz (Hz).

Relationship between time period and
frequency: If T is the time period of a simple
pendulum, then

In time 7 second, the number of oscillation is 1.

+. In time | second, the number of oscillations will

be —L

T which is the frequency /f.

1
f

Amplitude : The maximum displacement of the
bob from its mean position on either side, is called
the amplitude of oscillation. In Fig. 1.16, the
amplitude is OA or OB. It is denoted by the letter
a or A and is measured in metre (m).

Effective length of a pendulum : /f is the
distance of the point of oscillation O (i.e., the
centre of gravity of the bob) from the point of
suspension S. In Fig. 1.16 it is shown by J.

ie, | f= = or Tessa...

(ii) Measurement of time period of a simple
pendulum
To measure the time period of a simple
pendulum, the bob is slightly displaced from its
rest (mean) position O and is then released. It
begins to move to and fro about its mean

position O in a vertical plane along with the

string. The time ¢ for 20 complete oscillations is
measured with the help of a stop watch and then
dividing t by 20, its time period T is calculated*.

* To find time period, the time for number of oscillations .
more than | is noted because the least count of stop
watch is either 1 s or 0-5 s. It can not record the time
period in fraction such as 1-2 s or 1-4:s and so on. It is
made possible by noting the time ¢ for 20 oscillations or
more than it and then dividing ¢ by the number of.
oscillations.



--- Page 22 ---
The experiment is then repeated for different
lengths of the pendulum. The observations are
recorded in the table given below.

Time period for pendulum of different lengths

be noted that if the length of a pendulum is made
four times, the period of oscillation gets doubled
i.e., now it takes twice the time for one complete
to and fro motion. Thus time period T is directly
proportional to the square root of length / of the
pendulum (T « ,/; ) or the square of time period
T? is directly proportional to the length / of the
pendulum (i.e., T? « D or /T? is a constant.

(iii) Graph showing the variation of square of time
period (T7) with the length (1) of a pendulum
If a graph is plotted for the square of time period
(T*) taken on Y-axis against the length / taken on
X-axis, it comes out to be a straight line inclined to
the /-axix as shown in Fig. 1.17. This shows that 7?
is directly proportional to /.

by taking two points P and Q on the straight

This slope is found to be a constant at a place and

is equal to —— where g is the acceleration due to

gravity at that place. Thus g can be determined at a
place from these measurements by using the
following relation :

(v) Factors affecting the time period of a simple
pendulum

From experiments on simple pendulum, it is
observed that

(i) The time period of oscillation is directly
proportional to the square root of its effective length
i.e., Te ,f; or in other words, the square of time
period of oscillation (7%) is directly proportional to
its effective length (J) i.e., T? & |.

A pendulum clock has a compound pendulum
made up of a metal like brass (or steel). Due to
seasonal change of temperature, the effective length
of pendulum changes, due to which the clock goes
fast in winter and slow in summer. In winter due to
contraction, the effective length of the pendulum
gets shortened, and so its time period is decreased
and the pendulum completes more oscillations in a
given time i.e., the clock goes fast. But in summer
because of expansion i.e., increase in the effective
length of pendulum, its time period is increased and
it completes less number of oscillations in a given
time i.e., the clock goes slow.

Similarly, while swinging, if we stand on the
swing, the time period of swing decreases (i.e., the
swing moves faster). This is because when we
stand, the centre of gravity rises, so the effective
length of the swing decreases due to which its time
period decreases.

(ii) The time period of oscillation is inversely
proportional to the square root of acceleration due
1

vs

to gravity i.e.,T «

For this reason, a pendulum clock goes slow
(i.e., the time period of oscillation increases) when



--- Page 23 ---
it is taken to mountains or to mines due to decrease
in the value of g.*

(iii) The time period of oscillation does not
depend on the mass or material of the body
suspended (i.e., bob). If we take two pendulums
of equal lengths, but with bobs of different masses
or different materials, their time periods will remain
same.

(iv) The time period of oscillation does not
depend on the extent of swing on either side (i.e.,
on amplitude) provided the swing is not too large.

(vi) Expression for the time period of simple
pendulum

The time period of oscillation of the pendulum
is given by the following relation :

RV

T =

* The value of acceleration due to gravity g decreases with

altitude as well as with depth from the earth surface.

or $F~R* = 40° —) ae (1.10)
where JT = time period,

| = effective length of pendulum,
and g = acceleration due to gravity.

At a given place, since g is constant, the
time period of a pendulum of given length is
constant. This is why a pendulum can be used to
measure the time.

(vii) Seconds’ pendulum

The pendulum of a clock which we use to
note time in our house, is a seconds’ pendulum.
It takes time 1 s in moving from one extreme to
the other extreme, so its time period is 2 s. Thus,
a pendulum with a time period of oscillation equal
to two seconds, is known as a seconds pendulum.
The effective length of the seconds’ pendulum, at
a place where g = 9-8 m s~ (the average value),
is nearly 1 metre.

1. Calculate the length of a seconds’ pendulum at
