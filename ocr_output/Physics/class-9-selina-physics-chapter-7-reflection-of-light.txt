(A) LAWS OF REFLECTION & FORMATION OF IMAGE BY A PLANE MIRROR

7.1. REFLECTION OF LIGHT

When a beam of light strikes a surface, a part
of it returns into the same medium. The part of
light which is returned into the same medium is
called the reflected light. Thus

The return of light into the same medium
after striking a surface is called reflection.

The remaining part of light is either
absorbed if the surface on which the light strikes
is opaque or it is partly transmitted and partly
absorbed if the surface is transparent.

It is the reflection of light which enables us
to see the different objects around us. An object
is seen when light from it enters our eyes. The
luminous bodies which emit light by themselves
are directly seen, but the non-luminous objects
are seen only when they reflect the light incident
on them and the reflected light reaches our eyes.

Different surfaces reflect light to different
extent. A highly polished and silvered surface,
such as a plane mirror, reflects almost the entire
light falling on it.*

A plane mirror is made from a few mm
thick glass plate. One surface of glass plate is
polished to a high degree of smoothness. This
forms the front surface of mirror and the other

* A plane mirror does not reflect cent percent light falling on it.

(or back) surface is silvered (i.e., silver, mercury
or some suitable material is deposited over it).
The silvered surface is further coated with some
Opaque material so as to protect the silvering
on it. The two surfaces of plane mirror are
shown in Fig. 7.1. Light enters from the side of
polished surface and is strongly reflected from
the silvered surface. The coating serves as an
opaque surface and it does not reflect the light.

Kinds of reflection : There are the following
two kinds of reflection :

(i) Regular reflection, and

(ii) Irregular reflection.

(i) Regular reflection : Regular reflection
occurs when a beam of light falls on a smooth
and polished surface, such as a plane mirror. In

on a plane mirror. The reflected beam is also
parallel and it is in a fixed direction. It can be
seen only from a particular direction.

(ii) Irregular reflection : Irregular reflection
occurs when a beam of light falls on a rough
surface such as the wall of a room, the page of a
book or any other object. Although the wall of a
room or the page of a book appears to be smooth,
but actually it is quite uneven having many small
projections over it. In Fig. 7.2(b) light rays fall at
different points on a rough surface and each ray
gets reflected from it obeying the laws of reflection
of light. Due to uneven surface, at different points,
light rays get reflected in different directions and
give rise to the diffused or irregular reflection. As
a result, the reflected light spreads over a wide
area and it does not follow a particular direction.
Thus the reflected light can be seen from anywhere.

REFLECTION

(i) Incident ray : The light ray striking a
reflecting surface is called the incident ray.

(ii) Point of incidence : The point at which
the incident ray strikes the reflecting surface, is
called the point of incidence.

(iii) Reflected ray : The light ray obtained
after reflection from the surface, in the same
medium in which the incident ray is travelling,
is called the reflected ray.

(iv) Normal : The perpendicular drawn to
the surface at the point of incidence, is called
the normal.

(v) Angle of incidence : The angle which
the incident ray makes with the normal at the
point of incidence, is called the angle of
incidence. It is denoted by the letter i.

(vi) Angle of reflection : The angle which
the reflected ray makes with the normal at the
point of incidence, is called the angle of
reflection. It is denoted by the letter r

(vii) Plane of incidence : The plane
containing the incident ray and the normal, is
called the plane of incidence.

(viii) Plane of reflection : The plane
containing the reflected ray and the normal, is
called the plane of reflection.

In Fig. 7.3, MM, is a plane reflecting
surface (say, a plane mirror) kept perpendicular
to the plane of paper. A light ray is incident in
the direction AO at the point O on mirror. It is
reflected along the direction OB. Thus, AO is
the incident ray, O is the point of incidence and
OB is the reflected ray.

Let ON be the normal (or perpendicular)
drawn to the surface MM, at the point O. The
angle i (= ZAON), which the incident ray makes
with the normal, is the angle of incidence and the
angle. r (= <BON), which the reflected ray makes
with the normal, is the angle of reflection. The
plane of paper is the plane of incidence.

7.3 LAWS OF REFLECTION

A light ray obeys the following two laws
for reflection from a surface, which are called
the laws of reflection.

(2) The incident ray, the reflected ray and the |
normal at the point of incidence, lie in the
Same plane.

In Fig. 7.3, AO, ON and OB are in one plane
(i.e., the plane of paper).

Reflection of a ray of light normally incident
on a plane mirror

For a ray incident normally on a plane mirror,

the angle of incidence i = 0°, therefore the angle of
reflection r = 0°. Thus, a ray of light AO incident

normally on a mirror is reflected along the same
path OA i.e., it retraces its path as shown in Fig. 7.4.

74 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF
THE LAWS OF REFLECTION

Experiment : Fix a sheet of white paper on a
drawing board and draw a line MM, as shown in Fig. 7.5.
On this line, take a point O nearly at the middle of it and
draw a line OA such that “MOA is less than 90° (say,
<MOA = 60°). Then draw a normal ON on line MM, at
the point O, and place a small plane mirror vertical by
means of a stand with its silvered surface on the line MM).

Now fix two pins P and Q at some distance (= 5 cm)
apart vertically on line OA, on the board. Keeping eye on
other side of normal (but on the same side of mirror), see
clearly the images P’ and Q’ of the pins P and Q. Now fix
a pin R such that it is in line with the images P’ and Q’ as
observed in the mirror. Now fix one more pin S such that
the pin S is in line with the pin R as well as the images P’
and Q’ of pins P and Q.

Draw small circles on paper around the position
of pins as shown in Fig. 7.5. Remove the pins and
draw a line OB joining the point O to the pin points S
and R.

In Fig. 7.5, AO is the incident ray, OB is
the reflected ray, ZAON = i is the angle of
incidence and ZBON = r is the angle of
reflection. The angles AON and BON are
measured and recorded in the observation table.

The experiment is repeated for the ZMOA
equal to 50°, 40° and 30°.

Observations

From the above observation table, we find
that in each case, angle of incidence is equal
to the angle of reflection. This verifies the first
law of reflection.

The experiment is being performed on a
flat drawing board, with mirror normal to the
plane of board on which white sheet of paper
is being fixed. Since the lower tips of all the
four pins lie on the same plane (i.e., the plane
of paper), therefore the incident ray, the
reflected ray and the normal at the point of
incidence, all lie in one plane. This verifies the
second law of reflection.

7.5 FORMATION OF
REFLECTION

From each point of an illuminated object,
rays of light travel in all directions. To find the
position of image of an object formed by a
mirror after reflection, we need to consider at
least two rays of light incident on the mirror
from a point of object. Each incident ray gets
reflected obeying the laws of reflection. The
point where the two reflected rays actually meet
or they appear to meet (when produced
backwards), gives the position of image of that
point of object. Thus we can obtain the
positions of image of different points of the
object. By joining these points, complete image
of the object can be obtained.

Types of image : The image can be of
two types : (a) real image, and (b) virtual
image.

(a) Real image : The image which can be
obtained on a screen, is called a real image. It
is formed when light rays after reflection
actually intersect. It is inverted. For example,

IMAGE BY

143


--- Page 4 ---
for a distant object, the image formed by a
concave mirror is real.

(b) Virtual image : The image which
cannot be obtained on a screen, is called a
virtual image. It is formed when light rays
after reflection do not actually intersect, but
they appear to diverge from the image*.
Geometrically, they intersect when they are
produced backwards. It is erect. For example,
the image of an object formed by a plane
mirror or by a convex mirror is virtual.

7.6 IMAGE OF A POINT OBJECT FORMED
BY A PLANE MIRROR
In Fig. 7.6, let MM, be a plane mirror in
front of which a point object O is placed. From
the object O, rays of light travel in all directions.
To show the formation of image by the plane
mirror, we consider two rays from the object O

which fall on mirror MM,. Let OA and OB be
two rays incident from the object O which get
reflected from the mirror MM, in directions AC
and BD respectively such that ZCAN, = ZOAN,
and ZDBN, = ZOBN,. Here AN, and BN, are
the normals at the points A and B.

When seen from a position between C and
D, the rays between C and D appear to come from
some point / behind the mirror. The point J is the
image of the object O. To locate the position of J,
reflected rays AC and BD are produced backwards
and the point where they meet, gives the position
of image /. The image is virtual because the reflected
rays AC and BD do not actually meet at J, but to
our eye they appear to come from the point /.

7.7. IMAGE OF AN EXTENDED OBJECT
FORMED BY A PLANE MIRROR

In Fig. 7.7, let MM, be a plane mirror in front
of which an extended object AB is placed. From all
points of the object, light rays travel in all
directions. We consider only two rays incident on
the plane mirror from the end points A and B of the
object. Let AP and AQ be the two rays incident on
the mirror from the point A of the object which get
reflected from the mirror as PP’ and QQ'
respectively. These reflected rays when produced
backwards, meet at a point A’. Thus A’ is the virtual
image of point A. Similarly, from the point B of
object, BR and BS be the two incident rays on the
mirror which are reflected as RR’ and SS'
respectively. The reflected rays RR’ and SS’ meet
at a point B’ when produced backwards. Thus, B’ is
the virtual image of point B. Similarly, for all other
points of the object AB, virtual images are formed
between A’ and B’. Thus A'‘B’ is the virtual image

Fig. 7.7 Image of an extended object
formed by a plane mirror

144


--- Page 5 ---
of the object AB. It is erect and of size equal to that
of the object. The normal distance of each point of
image behind the mirror is same as the normal
distance of the corresponding object point in front
of the mirror (i.e., BN = B'N).

7.8 POSITION OF IMAGE

The image I is as far behind the mirror as
the object O is in front of it i.e., the perpendicular
distance of image from the mirror is equal to the
perpendicular distance of object from the mirror.

Proof : Fig. 7.8 shows the formation of
image of a point object O by a plane mirror MM,.
A ray OF incident normally on the mirror gets
reflected by the mirror along the same path (i.e.,
along FO), since Zi = 0°, therefore <r = 0°. The
other incident ray OA gets reflected along AC,
such that ZOAN = ZNAC where AN is the normal
drawn at the point A on mirror MM;,. The reflected
rays FO and AC meet at a point J when they are
produced backwards. The point / is the virtual
image of the point object O. We are to prove
that JF = OF.

Fig. 7.8 Formation of image of a point object due to
reflection at a plane mirror
For the incident ray OA reflected as AC,
ZOAN = angle of incidence i
ZCAN = angle of reflection r
By the law of reflection,
angle of incidence = angle of reflection
or ZOAN = ZCAN ...(7.2)

But <OAN = ZAOF (Alternate angles)

and <CAN = ZAIF (Corresponding angles)
ZAOF = ZAIF (7.3)

Now consider the triangles AOF and AIF
ZAOF = ZAIF

ZAFO = ZAFI (= 90°)

and FA is the common side.

Therefore, the triangles AOF and AIF are

congruent.

Hence, OF = IF wee (7.4)

Since OF is the normal drawn from the
object O on the mirror, so the normal distance of
the object from the mirror is equal to the normal
distance of image from the mirror. Thus,

The image is situated on the normal drawn from
the object on the mirror and it is as far behind

the mirror as the object is in front of it.

7.9 LATERAL INVERSION

In our daily experience while looking in a
mirror, we notice that a ring on the finger of our
left hand appears to be in the finger of the
right hand of our image as shown in Fig. 7.9.
Similarly, the pocket on the left appears to be on
the right in the image. This interchange of the left
and right sides is called the lateral inversion. Thus,

The interchange of the left and right sides

in the image of an object in a plane mirror
is called lateral inversion.

since their image remains unchanged (because each
of these letters has a symmetry about a vertical line
passing through the mid point of the letter).

(3) It is because of the lateral inversion that
it becomes difficult to read the text of a page
from its image formed by a plane mirror. But
one can easily read the text written in ‘laterally
inverted letters' formed by seeing its image in
a plane mirror. It is why the letters on the front
of an ambulance are written laterally inverted
like FOVAIUSMA, So that the driver of the
vehicle moving ahead of the ambulance reads the
word laterally inverted as AMBULANCE, in his
rear view mirror, and gives side to pass the
ambulance first.

(4) The image formed by a spherical
mirror is also laterally inverted.

7.10 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE IMAGE
FORMED BY A PLANE MIRROR
The image formed by a plane mirror has
the following characteristics :
(i) upright (or erect), (ii) virtual,
(iii) of same size as the object, and
(iv) laterally inverted.

“" "" "Ene locaton ortie image is given by the

fact that, the image is situated at the same
perpendicular distance behind the mirror as the
object is in front of it.

Note : If the object is shifted by a distance d
towards the mirror, the image will also shift by
the same distance d towards the mirror i.e., the
separation between the object and image will
decrease by 2d. Similarly, if an object moves with
a speed v towards (or away) from a mirror, the
image to him will appear to move with a speed 2v
towards (or away from) him.

Example : A boy standing at a distance 5 m
away from a plane mirror at A, finds his image at a
distance 10 m from him at A’. Now if he moves to
the position B by a distance 2 m still farther away
from the mirror, his distance from the mirror will
become 7 m and then to him, his image B’ will
appear to be at a distance 14 m from him as shown
in Fig. 7.11.

1. In a dark room, a parallel beam of light falls
on a plane mirror and another parallel beam
of light falls on a white wall. The light
reflected by the mirror can be seen only in a
certain direction, but the reflected light from
the wall can be seen from anywhere. Give
reason.

The plane mirror has a plane smooth reflecting
surface, so regular reflection takes place and the
reflected light goes in a fixed direction. Therefore,
the reflected light can be seen only in a certain
direction.

On the other hand, the wall is a rough surface
so irregular reflection takes place, and reflected
light gets diffused in all directions. Therefore, the
reflected light from the wall can be seen from
anywhere.

(B) IMAGES FORMED IN A PAIR OF MIRRORS

7.11 IMAGES FORMED

INCLINED MIRRORS
For an object kept in between the two inclined
plane mirrors, we get many images of the object.
This is because the light rays after reflection from
one mirror fall on the other mirror. In other words,
the image formed by one mirror acts as an object
for the other mirror. This continues till no more
reflection can occur on any mirror.

The object and the images sapien ib hel

IN TWO

ome of object from the pard wersettion

The number of images formed depends on
the angle 6° between the two mirrors. Following
two cases are possible :

Case (1):

If angle 6° between the mirrors is
such that n = * is odd,

(i) the number of images is n, when the
object is placed asymmetrically between
the mirrors.

(ii) the number of images is n — 1, when the
object is placed symmetrically (i.e., on the
bisector of the angle) between the mirrors.

Example : If @ is 72°, then n= = = 5, So

images formed will be n = 5 for the object placed
asymmetrically between the mirrors and images
formed will be (n — 1) = 4, if the object is placed
symmetrically (on the bisector) between the
mirrors because two images now overlap.

360°
Case (2): If n= eo is even, the number of
images is always n — 1 for all
positions of object in between the
mirrors.
Example : If the angle between two mirrors
360°
is 60°, n = v7 6, the number of images is

(n — 1) =5, ie. five images will be formed for all
positions of the object in between the mirrors..

We shall now consider image formation in
two special cases :

(a) When the two mirrors are parallel to each
other.

(b) When the two mirrors are perpendicular to
each other.

IMAGES FORMED IN A PAIR OF
MIRRORS PLACED PARALLEL TO
EACH OTHER

When two mirrors are kept parallel to each

7.12

Ginfinite), so the number of images of an object
kept in between the two parallel mirrors will be
infinite. Thus

For two mirrors kept parallel to each other,

an infinite number of images are formed for
an object kept in between them.

In Fig. 7.18, AM and BM, are the two plane
mirrors placed parallel to each other. An object P
is placed in between them. The image of P formed
by reflection from mirror AM is I, and by reflection
from mirror BM, is J’. The ray diagram for the
formation of image /' is not shown in Fig. 7.18.
Now /; acts as a virtual object for mirror BM, and
the image J, is formed. Similarly, J’ acts as the
virtual object for mirror AM and the image /" is
formed. In this manner, many images are formed.
But the brightness of the remote images keeps on
decreasing because at each reflection, some light
is absorbed, thus not more than few images are
seen. Fig. 7.18 shows the ray diagram for the
formation of one set of images only (i.e, 1), h,

" Js,...). The formation of other set of images (i.e.,

I’, I", ....) can similarly be obtained. All images lie

on the perpendicular drawn from the base of object

on the mirrors.

Use : In a showroom and in a barber’s shop,
mifrors are arranged in this manner.

Note : A thick plane mirror also forms a
multiple number of images due to multiple
reflections within the glass from front surface and
back reflecting surface. Out of these, the second
image formed due to reflection from the back
reflecting surface is brightest.

7.13 IMAGES FORMED BY TWO MIRRORS
PLACED PERPENDICULAR TO EACH
OTHER

When two mirrors are kept perpendicular
to each other, i.e., 8 = 90°, then

.. for an object placed in between the two
perpendicular mirrors, the number of images
formed will be n — 1 = 3. Thus

For two mirrors kept perpendicular to each
other, three images are formed for an abject
kept in between them. —

In Fig. 7.19, AO and OB are the two plane
mirrors kept mutually perpendicular to each other.
Let P be an object in between the two mirrors.
The image of object P formed by reflection from
the mirror OB is P» and by reflection from the
mirror OA is P|. Fig. 7.19 shows ray diagram for
the formation of image P only. Now the image
P, acts as the virtual object for the mirror OA
since rays after reflection from mirror OF fall on

Fig. 7.19 Images formed in two perpendicular mirrors

the mirror OA. For this, the image formed by
mirror OA is P3. Similarly, P; acts as the virtual
object for the mirror OB since the rays after
reflection from the mirror OA fall on mirror OB
(they are not shown in figure). For this, the image
formed by mirror OB is P, which is at the same
point as P; (i.e., the image P, of P, in mirror OB
overlaps with the image P3; of P, in mirror OA).
As such, three images of object are formed in
this case. In Fig. 7.19, ray diagram for the
formation of images P, and P3 is shown.
Similarly, we can draw the ray diagram for the
formation of images P, and P,. Geometrically it
can be seen that the images P,, P2, P3 and the
object P, all lie on a circle whose centre is at O
(the point of intersection of the two mirrors OA
and OB) and radius is OP.

7.14 USES OF PLANE MIRROR
The plane mirrors find wide applications

in our daily life. Some of the applications of a

plane mirror are given below.

(1) The most common and wide use is as a
looking glass.

(2) In the optician’s room to increase the effective
length of the room. It is done by keeping a
plane mirror on the front wall and the sign
board on the opposite wall, just behind the
patient. For the patient, the sign board is at
nearly double the length of the room.

(3) In the barber’s shop for seeing the hairs at
the back of head. Here two mirrors facing
each other are fixed on the opposite walls at
the front and back of the viewer.

(4) In a periscope, two parallel plane mirrors each
inclined at 45° with the vertical walls are placed
facing each other.

(5) In a kaleidoscope, three plane mirrors inclined
with each other at 60° are used. If small
coloured bangle pieces are kept between the
mirrors, beautiful hexagonal patterns are seen
on rotating the tube.

(6) In solar heating devices such as solar cooker,
solar water heater, etc., a plane mirror is used
to reflect the incident light rays from sun on
the substance to be heated.

7.16 BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF TERMS
RELATED TO A SPHERICAL MIRROR

(1) Centre of curvature

of the sphere. of which the minor pe
In Fig. 7.22, it is represented by the symbol C.
The normal at any point of the mirror
passes through the centre of curvature C. In other
words, a line joining any point on the surface
of mirror to the centre of curvature C will be
normal to the surface of mirror at that point.

(2) Radius of curvature

The radius of sphere of which thé:
mirror is a part, is called the. ‘rigglius of

curvature of the mirror.

Thus, it is the distance of centre of
curvature C from any point on the surface of
mirror. In Fig. 7.22, distance PC is the radius
of curvature. It is represented by the symbol R.

(3) Pole

It is the central point of the surface of the
mirror. It is represented by the letter P as shown
in Fig. 7.22.

(4) Aperture ’
The plane surface area of the mirror through

which the light rays enter and fall on the
mirror is called its aperture.

Thus for the mirror shown in Fig. 7.22, AB
is the diameter of aperture.

(5) Principal axis

It is the straight line joining the pole of the
mirror to its centre of curvature.

In Fig. 7.22, the line PC represents the
principal axis. It can extend on either side.

7.17 REFLECTION OF LIGHT RAY FROM
A SPHERICAL MIRROR

From a spherical mirror, reflection of light
follows the same laws of reflection as for the
plane surface (i.e. angle of incidence i = angle of
reflection r and the incident ray, reflected ray and
the normal lie in same plane).

Note : In a spherical mirror, to obtain the
direction of reflected ray for a given incident
ray, first draw a normal at the point of
incidence. For this, draw a line joining the point
of incidence to the centre of curvature C*. Then
draw a line on the other side of the normal,
making an angle (i.e., the angle of reflection)
equal to the angle of incidence. This line
represents the reflected ray.

Example : In Fig. 7.23, we are to find the
direction of reflected ray for an incident ray AD
on a concave mirror and convex mirror for
which C is the position of centre of curvature.

(a) CONCAVE MIRROR

Fig. 7.23 Reflection of a ray of light from

(b) CONVEX MIRROR

* The line joining the point of incidence to the centre of
curvature is normal to the tangent drawn on the spherical
surface at the point of incidence, so it becomes normal at
the point of incidence.

152


--- Page 13 ---
For this, the point of incidence D is joined to
the centre of curvature C to get the normal DC
on the mirror at the point of incidence D. Then
the reflected ray DB is drawn such that
ZBDC = ZADC in concave mirror and
ZBDC’ = ZADC in convex mirror.

7.18 FOCUS AND FOCAL LENGTH

For concave mirror : In Fig. 7.24, the rays
of light are incident parallel to its principal axis
on a concave mirror. Each ray gets reflected
from the mirror obeying the law of reflection
(i.e, angle of incidence i = angle of
reflection r) for which the dotted line joining the
point of incidence to the centre of curvature C
acts as normal at the point of incidence. We note
that in Fig. 7.24, concave mirror converges the
rays on reflection and the rays after reflection
pass through a point F on the principal axis. This
point is called the focus of concave mirror. Thus
a concave mirror has a real focus because the
reflected rays actually meet at this point. The
focus is represented by the ° Symbos F. Thus

| reflection from 1 the | mitrot:

PRINCIPAL
AXIS

Fig. 7.24 Focus and focal length
of a concave mirror

The distance of focus F from the pole P of
the mirror is called its focal length. i.e., focal

length f = PF

For convex mirror : In Fig. 7.25, the rays
of light are incident parallel to the principal
axis on a convex mirror. Each ray after
reflection appears to diverge and the reflected
rays do not meet at any point, but they appear
to come from a point F on the principal axis,
behind the mirror. This point is called the focus
of the convex mirror. This point is obtained
geometrically, when the reflected rays are

produced backwards. Thus a convex mirror has
a virtual focus. Thus,

The focus of a convex mirror is a point on the
principal axis from which, the light rays
incident parallel to the principal axis, appear
to come, after reflection from the mirror.

Fig. 7.25 Focus and focal length of
a convex mirror

The distance of the focus F from pole P
of the mirror is called its focal length i.e.,
focal length f= PF.

Focal plane : A plane passing through the
focus and normal to the principal axis of the mirror,
is called focal plane. A parallel beam of light
inclined to the principal axis get focused at a point
in this plane [Fig. 7.26(a) and Fig. 7.26(b)]. It is
the point where the ray passing through the centre
of curvature meets the focal plane.

7.19 CONVENIENT RAYS FOR’ THE
CONSTRUCTION OF IMAGE BY RAY
DIAGRAM

Although from each point of an object,
infinite number of rays travel in all directions, but
to find the position and nature of image formed
due to reflection from a spherical mirror by
drawing, we need to consider at least two rays
incident on the mirror from the same point of the
object. Any two of the following rays are taken as
the convenient incident rays :

(1) Aray passing through the centre of curvature,
(2) A ray parallel to the principal axis,

(3) A ray passing through the focus,

(4) A ray incident at the pole.

(1) A ray passing through the centre of curvature

A line joining the centre of curvature to any
point on the surface of mirror is normal to the
mirror at that point, therefore a ray AD passing
through the centre of curvature C (or appearing
to pass through the centre of curvature C) is
incident normally on the spherical mirror. Since
its angle of incidence is zero, therefore the angle
of reflection will also be zero and the ray AD
gets reflected along its own path DA as shown in
Fig. 7.27. Thus

A ray ‘passing through (or directed towards $)
the centre of curvature of a spherical within i is
reflected back along its own path. -

(2) A ray parallel to the principal axis
A ray of light AD incident parallel to the
principal axis, after reflection passes either
through the focus F (in a concave mirror) or will

appear to come from the focus F (in a convex
mirror) along DB as shown in Fig. 7.28 . Thus

A ray incident parallel to the principal axis,
after reflection from a spherical mirror either
Passes or appears to be coming from focus.

A ray of light AD incident on the mirror
passing through the focus F (in a concave
mirror) or converging at the focus F (in a convex
mirror) after reflection becomes parallel to the
principal axis as DB (Fig. 7.29). Thus

converging at the focus), after reflection from

the angle of incidence ZAPC is equal to the
angle of reflection ZBPC in a concave mirror
(or ZAPC’ = ZBPC’ in a convex mirror) as
shown in Fig. 7.30. In this case, principal axis
itself is the normal at the pole. Thus

7.20 RAY DIAGRAMS FOR FORMATION
OF IMAGES IN A CONCAVE MIRROR

We shall now find the position, size and
nature of image by drawing the ray diagram for
a small linear object placed on the principal axis
of a concave mirror at different positions.

Case (i) : When the object is at infinity

When the object (e.g. sun) is at infinity, the
rays of light reaching the concave mirror even
from the different points of the object subtend
nearly the same angle at each point of the mirror,
so they can be treated to be parallel to each other.
In Fig. 7.31, let two rays AD and BE from the
same point of object are incident on the concave
mirror, parallel to its principal axis CP. They after
reflection from the concave mirror pass through
its focus F as DF and EF respectively. The two
reflected rays DF and EF meet at the focus F.
Hence a real and point image is formed at the
focus. Thus

whe the focus F- It is (i) Real, (ii) He
(iti) Diminished ‘to a point.

Fig. 7.31 When the object is at infinity

Case (ii) : When the object is at a far distance

Consider two rays AP and BD from the
same point of an object (e.g. a tree) incident on
a concave mirror, parallel to each other as
shown in Fig 7.32. The incident ray AP striking
at the pole P is reflected along PA,, such that
ZAPC = ZA,PC (i.e, Zi = Zr ). Similarly the
other ray BD is reflected along DA, such that
ZBDC = ZA,DC (since DC is normal at the
point D). The reflected rays PA, and DA,
intersect at a point A, which is the image of the
point of the object. The point A, lies on the focal
plane of the mirror. Similarly, the rays from other
points of the object also converges in the focal
plane thus forming the image along A,F. Hence
AjF is an inverted, real and highly diminished
image formed in the focal plane of the concave
mirror. Thus

When object is at a far distance, image is in
the focal plane of the mirror. It is (i) Real,
(ii) Inverted, and (iii) Highly diminished.

Fig. 7.32 When the object is at far distance

Case (iii) : When object is beyond the centre of
curvature

In Fig. 7.33, AB is an object placed beyond
the centre of curvature C. Consider two light rays
from a point A of the object. A ray AD incident
parallel to the principal axis, after reflection from
the concave mirror passes through its focus F
along DA,. Another ray AE passing through the
centre of curvature C is incident normally on the
mirror, so it gets reflected back as EA. The two
reflected rays DA, and EA intersect at a point A,
to form the image. Similarly, the image is formed
at points between A, and B, for other points of
the object between A and B. So image A,B, is
obtained between the focus F and the centre of
curvature C. The image is real, inverted and
diminished. Thus

155


--- Page 16 ---
When object is beyond the centre of curvature
C, the image is between the focus F and

the centre of curvature C. It is (i) Real,
(ii) Inverted, and (iti) Diminished.

Ee

Fig. 7.33 When the object is beyond centre

of curvature C

Case (iv) : When object is at the centre of
curvature C

In Fig. 7.34, AB is an object placed at the centre
of curvature C. An incident ray of light AD being
parallel to the principal axis, passes through its focus
F along DA, after reflection. The other ray AE, being
incident on the concave mirror through focus F,
becomes parallel to the principal axis as EA), after
reflection. The two reflected rays DA, and EA, meet
at a point A, to form the image. Similarly, the image
is formed for other points of the object and B,A, is
the image of the object AB formed at the centre of
curvature C itself. It is real, inverted and of same size
as the object. Thus

When the object is at the centre of ciirvature C,
the image is also at the centre of curvature C.
It is (i) Real, (ii) Inverted, and (ii):Stze

as that of the object. oe

Fig. 7.34 When the object is at centre of curvature C

_ Case (v) : When object is between the centre of
curvature C and focus F
In Fig. 7.35, AB is an object placed between
Cand F. An incident ray of light AD from the point
A of the object is parallel to the principal axis, so
it passes through its focus F after reflection along
DA,. Another ray AE, being incident on the
concave mirror through focus F, becomes parallel

to the principal axis as EA, after reflection. The
two reflected rays DA, and EA, intersect at a point
A, to form the image of point A of the object.
Similarly, the image is formed on A,B, for the other
points on the object AB, thus the image A,B, is
formed beyond the centre of curvature C which is
real, inverted and magnified. Thus,

When the object is between the centre of
curvature C and the focus F, the image is
beyond the centre of curvature C. It is (i) Real,
(ii) Inverted, and (iii) Magnified.

Fig. 7.35 When the object is between
centre of curvature C and focus F

Case (vi) : When object is at the focus F

In Fig. 7.36, AB is an object placed at the
focus F. A ray of light AD is incident on the
mirror parallel to the principal axis and so it
gets reflected along DF, passing through its focus
F. The other ray AE moving in direction CA,
appears to be coming from the centre of
curvature C, so it gets reflected back along FA.
The two reflected rays DF and EA are parallel
to each other which are assumed to meet at
infinity, so image is formed at infinity. In this
case image is real, inverted and highly
magnified. Thus

When the object is at the focus F, the image
is at infinity. It is (i) Real, Gi) Inverted, and:
(iii) Highly magnified. oe

Fig. 7.36 When the object is at focus F

Case (vii) : When the object is between the
focus F and the pole P
In Fig. 7.37, AB is an object placed between

156


--- Page 17 ---
pole P, and focus F. A light ray AD incident
parallel to the principal axis, gets reflected along
DF passing through its focus F and the incident
ray AE coming from the centre of curvature C
gets reflected back along EA. The two reflected
rays DF and EA do not intersect each other, but
they appear to diverge from a point A, (when
produced backwards). For an eye between C and
F, the reflected rays appear to come from A,
which is the virtual image of A. Similarly, image
is formed for other points on the object and an
image A,B, is formed behind the mirror which is
virtual, upright and magnified. Thus

When the object is between the focus F and
pole P, the image is behind the mirror. It is

(i) Virtual (ii) Upright, and (iii) Magnified.

Fig. 7.37 When the object is between focus
F and pole P

Note : In this case, as the object AB moves
towards its pole P, image A,B, formed behind the
mirror, also shifts towards the pole P and its size keeps
on decreasing, but it remains bigger than the object AB.
Finally when the object AB comes very close to the
pole P of the mirror, the virtual image will be at the
pole and it is of size same as of object.

Inference : In case of a concave mirror, the
image formed can be real as well as virtual; it
can be diminished, of the same size as well as
magnified. The nature and size of the image
depends on the position of object. For the object
situated beyond focus, the image is always real
and inverted, whereas for the object situated
between the focus and pole, the image is upright
and virtual. The image is diminished when the
object is beyond centre of curvature, but it
becomes magnified as the object comes within
the centre of curvature. The image is of size of
the object when the object is at the centre of
curvature.

The table below gives the position, size and

nature of the image formed by a concave murror
corresponding to the different positions of the
object.

7.21 RAY DIAGRAM FOR FORMATION OF

IMAGE IN A CONVEX MIRROR

In Fig. 7.38, AB is a linear object placed in
front of a convex mirror. Consider two rays
starting from a point A of the object. A ray of
light AD, incident parallel to the principal axis is
reflected along DM such that it appears to
diverge from its focus F. The other ray AE
travelling towards the centre of curvature C, falls
normally on the mirror, so it is reflected back as
EA along the same path. The two reflected rays
DM and EA meet at a point A, when they are
produced backwards. In other words, the
reflected rays appear to come from a point A,

Fig. 7.38 Image formation in convex mirror

--- Page 18 ---
which is the virtual image of A. Similarly, for the
rays incident from the other points of the object,
a Virtual image is formed along A,B, which is
situated between the pole and focus. The image
is virtual, erie and diminished. Thus

G). Virmih,. Gi) Upright, and @ii

Note : When the object, in front of a
convex mirror, is at a distance equal to the
focal length of mirror, the image is exactly at
the midpoint between its pole and focus.

Inference : In a convex mirror, the image
formed is always virtual, upright, and diminished,
It is always situated between its pole and focus,
irrespective of the distance of object in front of
the mirror. As the object comes closer to the
mirror from a far distance, its image shifts from
focus towards the pole and increases in size.

The table below gives the position, size
and nature of image formed by a convex mirror
for the different positions of the object.

7.22 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
FOCAL LENGTH AND RADIUS OF
CURVATURE

Proof* :

In Fig. 7.39 and Fig. 7.40, P is
the pole, C is the centre of curvature and F is
the focus of the mirror. The distance PF is equal

* Not included in the syllabus

to the focal length f the distance PC is equal to
the radius of curvature R of the mirror.

For concave mirror —

In Fig. 7.39, a ray light BD, parallel to the
principal axis PC, is incident on the concave
mirror PD. After reflection, it goes along DR
passing through its focus F.

Fig. 7.39 Relationship between f and R
for a concave mirror

Then <BDC = ZDCF (alternate angles)
and ZBDC = ZCDF

(law of reflection, Zi =r)
Hence ZDCF = ZCDF

*, A FDC is isosceles. Hence DF = FC
If aperture of the mirror is small, the
point D is very close to the point P, then DF = PF
PF=FC or PF + PF = PF + FC
or 2PF=PC

1 1
or PF=5 PCorf=,R

For convex mirror —

In Fig. 7.40, a ray of light BD incident on
the convex mirror, parallel to the principal axis
PC, after reflection appears to come from its
focus F. At the point of incidence D, the normal
on mirror is DC.

Fig. 7.40 Relationship between f and R
for a convex mirror

Then <BDN = ZFCD (corresponding angles)
ZBDN = ZNDR (law of reflection, Zi = Zr)

and ZNDR = ZCDF vertically opposite angles)

158


--- Page 19 ---
Hence ZFCD = “CDF
.. A FDC is isosceles. Hence, DF = FC

If the aperture of the mirror is small,
the point D is very close to the point P. Then
DF = PF

PF =FC or PF + PF = PF + FC

or 2PF=PC

Examples : (1) A concave mirror of radius
of curvature 20 cm has its focal length equal to
10 cm.

(2) A convex mirror of focal length 15 cm
has its radius of curvature equal to 30 cm.

7.23 SIGN CONVENTION FOR THE
MEASUREMENT OF DISTANCES

To specify the position of object and image,
we need a reference point and sign convention.
We follow the cartesian sign convention,
according to which the rules are :

(i) All distances are measured from the pole
of the mirror taken as origin. The rays are made
incident from the left.

(ii) The distances measured along the
principal axis in the direction of incident light,
are positive while those opposite to the incident
light, are negative.

(iii) The distances above the principal axis
are taken positive and those below the principal
axis are taken negative.

This convention gives the focal length of
a concave mirror to be negative (since in
Fig. 7.24. PF is the distance measure opposite to
the incident rays), and that of convex mirror to
be positive (since in Fig. 7.25, PF is the distance
measured in the direction of incident rays). For
convenience, the object is placed to the left of
the mirror so that the graphical convention of
sign comes into operation.

Fig. 7.41 shows the sign convention in
concave and convex mirror.

7.24 FORMULAE FOR THE SPHERICAL
MIRROR
(1) The expression relating the distance of
object u, distance of image v and focal length f
for a spherical mirror, is called the formula for
spherical mirror. It is gives as :

(7.6)

In the above relation, the values of known
quantities out of u, v and f are substituted with
their proper sign. For a concave mirror, the
values of u and f are always negative, while the
value of v is negative for a real image and
positive for a virtual image. For a convex mirror,
the value of u is always negative and the values
of v and f are always positive.

(2) If the length of the object and image are
measured perpendicular to the principal axis, the
ratio of length of the image to the length of the
object, is called linear magnification. If length of
the image is / and that of the oject is O, then

159


--- Page 20 ---
; ; Length of the image (/)
Magnification m = Length of the object (O)
Distance of image (v)
= Distance of object (u)

or .(7.7)

For the real image, u and v both are
negative, so linear magnification m is negative.
For virtual image, u is negative and v is positive,
so linear magnification m is positive. A real
image is always inverted, while a virtual image
is always errect.

7.25 USES OF SPHERICAL MIRRORS
Uses of a concave mirror

(1) As a shaving mirror : When a concave
mirror is held near the face (such that face is
between the pole and focus of mirror), it gives an
upright and magnified image as shown in
Fig. 7.37 and hence even the tiny hairs on the face
can easily be seen. For this, a concave mirror of
large focal length (so that the face always lies
between its focus and the pole) and large
aperature (so as to view the entire face) is used.

(2) As a reflector : In torch, search light,
and head light of automobiles, cars or cycles etc.,
a concave polished metallic surface is used as a
reflector to obtain a parallel beam of light. For
this, the source of light (i.e., bulb) is placed at the
focus of concave reflector. The rays of light from
the bulb fall on the concave reflector which after
reflection form a parallel beam (Fig. 7.42).

BULB

CONCAVE
MIRROR

Fig. 7.42 Use of a concave mirror as a reflector

(3) As a dentist’s head mirror : If a
parallel beam of light is incident on a concave
mirror, it focuses the beam to a point
[Fig. 7.26(a)]. This fact enables us to use it as a
doctor’s head mirror to concentrate a light beam
on a small area of the body part (such as teeth,
nose, throat, ear, etc.) to be examined. For this,
a parallel beam of light is made to fall on a

concave mirror attached to the band tied at the
fore-head of doctor examining the body part.

Uses of a convex mirror

. (1) As a reflector in street lamps : A
convex polished metallic surface is used in street
lamp as a reflector so as to diverge light over a
larger area.

(2) As a rear view mirror : A convex mirror
diverges the incident light beam and always forms
a virtual, small and erect image between its pole
and focus. This fact enables the driver to use it
as a rear view mirror in vehicles to see all the
traffic approaching from behind. Although a plane
mirror can also be used for the purpose, but a
convex mirror provides a much wider field of view
as compared to a plane mirror of the same size.
The ray diagrams in Fig. 7.43 show how a convex
mirror provides a wider field of view than a plane
mirror of the same aperture. Here D is the position
of the driver of the vehicle.

--- Page 21 ---
There can be the following three cases :

Case (i) : If image is upright, of same size
and it does not change in size by moving the
mirror towards or away from the face, the mirror
is plane.

Case (ii) : If image is upright, magnified,
and increases in size on small movement of the
mirror away, the mirror is concave.

Case (iii) : If image is upright, diminished
and decreases in size on small movement of the
mirror away, the mirror is convex.

The completed
ray diagram
is shown in
Fig. 7.47. The
image is formed at

(behind the
mirror). It is virtual, erect and diminished.

3. In case of a convex mirror, if object is moved
away from the mirror, how do the position,
size and nature of image change ?

Fig. 7.47

As the object is moved away from a convex
mirror, the distance of virtual image from the
mirror (formed behind it between pole and focus)
increases i.e., the image shifts from the pole
towards the focus and the size of the image
gradually decreases. When the object is at infinity
(very far), the image is at its focus. The image
is always erect and virtual.

4, An object is brought from a far distance
towards a concave mirror. How do the nature,
position and size of image change ?


--- Page 22 ---
When object is very tar trom the concave mfrror, a.

its image is at the focus and it is real, diminished,
and inverted. As the object is brought towards
the mirror, the image shifts away from the mirror
and its size increases, but it remains smaller than
the object. When the object is at centre of
curvature of the mirror, the image is also at the
centre of curvature and it is of size equal to the
size of the object. By further bringing the object
towards the mirror, the image gets magnified and
it moves away from the centre of curvature.
When object is at focus of mirror, the image is
at infinity. The image remains real and inverted.
If the object is further moved towards the mirror,
the image now becomes virtual, erect and
magnified and it is formed behind the mirror.
