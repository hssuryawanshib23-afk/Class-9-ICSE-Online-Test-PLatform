(A) HEAT AND TEMPERATURE; ANOMALOUS EXPANSION

6.1 CONCEPT OF HEAT (HEAT AS ENERGY)

It is our common experience that on rubbing
our palms, they get heated ; on passing electric
current in a metallic wire, the wire gets heated;
on burning coal, we get heat; on pumping air in
a bicycle tube, the barrel of pump gets heated. In
all these cases, heat is produced either by doing
work or by providing energy in some form other
than heat. On rubbing palms and on pumping air
in a bicycle tube, heat is produced by doing work
i.e., from mechanical energy, while on passing
current in a metallic wire, heat is obtained from
electrical energy and on burning coal, heat is
obtained from chemical energy. Thus heat is also
a form of energy.

Each body is made up of molecules. The
‘molecules are in random motion and each
molecule exerts a force of attraction on other
molecules. Thus molecules possess energy and
the heat energy of a body is the internal energy*

* Total internal energy is equal to the sum of internal kinetic

energy due to molecular motion and internal potential
energy due to molecular attractive forces.

of its molecules. A hot body has more internal
energy than an identical cold body. When a hot
body is kept in contact with a cold body, the cold
body warms up and the hot body cools down i.e.,
the internal energy of cold body increases and
that of the hot body decreases. Thus energy is
transferred from the hot body to the cold body
when they are placed in contact. The energy
which flows from hot body to the cold body is
called the heat energy or simply the heat.

On touching, a body appears hot to us when
heat energy flows from that body to our hand,
while it appears cool to us when heat energy flows
from our hand to the body.

Example : If we touch warm water, we feel
hot because heat energy from warm water passes
to our hand. Similarly, if we touch a cube of ice,
we feel cool because heat energy from our hand
passes to the cube of ice.

Thus we can define heat as follows :

Heat is the internal energy of molecules
constituting the body. It flows from a hot body
to a cold body.

Unit of heat

The unit of heat is same as that of energy.
The S.I. unit of heat is joule (abbreviated as J)
and its C.GS. unit is erg, where

1 J = 10’ erg (6.1)

Other units of heat are calorie (cal) and
kilocalorie (kcal), where

...(6.2)
The units calorie and joule are related as :
1 cal = 4-186 J (or nearly 4-2 J) ...(6.3)

6.2 CONCEPT OF TEMPERATURE

When a hot body is kept in contact with a
cold body, it is noticed that after some time, the
hot body becomes less hot and the cold body
becomes less cold. Obviously, this is because of
the flow of heat from hot body to the cold body.
The body which imparts heat is said to be at a
higher temperature than the body which receives
heat. Thus, temperature determines the direction
of flow of heat.

When a body receives heat energy, the
particles constituting the body start vibrating more
vigorously and its temperature rises provided its
physical state or dimensions remain unchanged.

Thus temperature is defined as below.

1 kilocalorie = 1000 calories

Temperature is a quantity which tells the
thermal state of a body (i.e., the degree of
hotness or coldness of the body). It determines
the direction of flow of heat when two bodies
at different temperatures are placed in contact.

Difference between heat and temperature

. Heat is a form of energy obtained due to random
motion of molecules in a substance

. The SL. unit of heat is joule (J)

. The amount of heat contained in a body depends
_ On mass, temperature and material of body.

. Heat is measured by the principle of calorimetry.

. Two bodies having same. quantity of heat may
differ in their temperature.

. When two bodies are placed in contact, the total
amount of heat is equal to the sum of heat of the
individual bodies.

If there is no transfer of heat between the
two bodies placed in contact, they are said to be
at the same temperature, but it does not mean that
they have equal amount of heat in them. In fact,
temperature alone does not tell us the quantity of
heat energy contained in a body. Experimentally,
we find that by imparting same quantity of heat
energy to different bodies, they get heated to
different temperatures. The amount of heat energy
contained by a body depends on its mass,
temperature and the material of the body.

Unit of temperature

The S.J. unit of temperature is kelvin
(symbol K). The other most common unit of
temperature is degree celsius (symbol °C) and
degree fahrenheit (symbol °F).

The temperature on Celsius scale and Kelvin
scale are related as :

T K = 273 + 14°C ...(6.4)*

Thus, by adding 273 to the temperature in
degree celsius, we get the temperature in Kelvin.
Actually a degree on both the Kelvin and Celsius
scales is equal.

The ice point is 0°C on Celsius scale, 32°F
on Fahrenheit scale and 273 K on the Kelvin
scale. The steam point is 100°C on Celsius scale,
212°F on Fahrenheit scale and 373 K on the
Kelvin scale. Thus there are 100 equal degrees
between the ice point and steam point on both
the Celsius and Kelvin scales, but 180 equal
divisions on the Fahrenheit scale. Thus 1 degree

9
on Celsius scale is 5 degree on Fahrenheit scale.

* More precisely T K = 273-15 + 4 °C

. Temperature is a quantity which determines the
direction of flow of heat on keeping the two bodies
at different temperatures in contact.

. The S.1. unit of temperature is kelvin (K).

. The temperature of a body depends on the average
kinetic energy of its molecules due to their random
motion. .

. Temperature is measured by a thermometer.

. Two bodies at same temperature may differ in
the quantities of heat contained in them.

. When two bodies at different temperatures are

placed in contact, the resultant temperature is a
temperature in between the two temperatures.

120


--- Page 3 ---
The zero of the Kelvin scale is called absolute
zero and it is at a temperature when molecular
motion ceases. It is at -273°C i.e. 0 K = -273°C.

The temperature on Celsius and Fahrenheit

Cc F -32
scales are related as : 5779. ...(6.5)

6.3 THERMAL EXPANSION
Almost all substances (solids, liquids and
gases) expand on heating and contract on cooling.

The expansion of a substance on heating is
called the thermal expansion of that substance.

A solid has a definite shape, so when a solid
is heated, it expands in all directions ie., the
length, area and volume, all increase on heating.
The increase in length is called the linear
expansion, the increase in area is called the
superficial expansion and the increase in volume
is called the cubical expansion. The liquids and
gases do not have a definite shape, so they have
only the cubical (or volume) expansion. On
heating, liquids expand more than the solids, and
gases expand much more than the liquids.

Some substances such as water from 0°C
to 4°C, silver iodide from 80°C to 141°C and
silica below —80°C contract on heating and
expand on cooling. The expansion of a substance
on cooling in a certain range of temperature is
called the anomalous expansion of that
substance. Here we shall study the anomalous
expansion of water.

6.4 ANOMALOUS EXPANSION OF WATER
If we take some water at 0°C and start heating
it, we find that it contracts (instead of expanding)
in the temperature range from 0°C to 4°C. On
heating it further above 4°C, it expands. Similarly,
if water initially at a temperature above 4°C is
cooled, it contracts till the temperature of water
reaches 4°C. On further cooling it below 4°C to
O°C, it expands. This unusual expansion of water
on cooling it in the temperature range 4°C to 0°C,
is called anomalous expansion of water. Thus,
The expansion of water when it is cooled
Jrom #C to OC, is known as anomalous
expansion of water.

Fig. 6.1 Variation in volume of water in range of

from 0°C to 10°C. The volume of water first
decreases on heating it from 0°C to 4°C and then
increases on further heating it from 4°C to 10°C.
The volume of water is thus minimum at 4°C. For
1 g of water, the volume at 4°C is 1-0000 cm?.
Fig. 6.2 shows the variation in density of
water with temperature in the range from 0°C to
10°C. When water is heated from 0°C, the density
of water first increases from 0°C to 4°C and then
decreases above 4°C to 10°C. On the other hand,
on cooling water from 10°C, the density of water -
first increases up to 4°C and then decreases when
it is cooled further below 4°C to 0°C. Thus the
density of water is maximum at 4°C which is
equal to 1 g cm™ (or 1000 kg m7).

HOPE'S EXPERIMENT TO
DEMONSTRATE THE ANOMALOUS
EXPANSION OF WATER

In 1805, the scientist T.C. Hope devised a
simple arrangement, known as Hope's apparatus
for demonstrating the anomalous expansion of
water. Fig 6.3 shows the Hope's apparatus.

6.5

The apparatus consists of a tall metallic
cylinder provided with two side openings P near
the top and Q near the bottom, fitted with
thermometers 7, and 7, respectively. The central

part of the cylinder is surrounded by a cylindrical
trough containing a freezing mixture of ice and salt.
The cylinder is filled with pure water at room
temperature. The temperature recorded by both
the thermometers is observed at a regular
interval of time.

Observations : (i) Initially both the
thermometers 7, and T, show same temperature,
(i.e., room temperature).

(ii) First the temperature recorded by
lower thermometer 7, starts decreasing and
finally it becomes steady at 4°C, while the
temperature recorded in upper thermometer 7;
remains almost unchanged during this time.

(iii) While the temperature recorded by
lower thermometer 7, remains constant at 4°C,
the upper thermometer 7, shows a continuous
fall in temperature up to O°C and then it also
becomes steady.

Thus finally the temperature recorded by
upper thermometer T, is 0°C and that by lower
thermometer T> is 4°C.

Fig. 6.4 shows the variation in temperature
recorded by thermometers 7, and T> with time.

Fig. 6.4 Variation in temperature with time recorded
by the thermometers T, and T,

Explanation : Initially water in cylinder is
at room temperature (say 12°C) which is indicated
by the point A in the graphs. As the freezing
mixture cools water in the central portion of the
cylinder, water contracts and its density increases.
Consequently the cooled water sinks to the bottom
and warm water from the bottom rises up to take
its place. Thus by convection, water of the lower
part cools, so the reading of the lower
thermometer T> falls rapidly. The reading of upper
thermometer 7; does not change because the
temperature of water in the upper part does not
change. This continues till temperature of entire
water below the central portion reaches at 4°C.
This is shown by the part AB in graphs (a) and
(b). Now the reading of lower thermometer 7,
becomes steady. On further cooling below 4°C,
due to anomalous expansion, water of the central
portion now expands, so its density decreases
and hence it rises up. To take its place, water
from top descends down and by convection, water
above the central portion cools. So the reading
of upper thermometer 7; now falls rapidly till
0°C and water near the top freezes to form ice at
0°C. Now the thermometer 7, shows the steady
temperature 0°C. This is shown by the part BC
in graphs (a) and (b). At this stage, the lower
thermometer T, shows the temperature 4°C at
which water has the maximum density while the
upper thermometer T, shows the temperature of
water and ice at 0°C.

6.6 CONSEQUENCES OF ANOMALOUS

EXPANSION OF WATER
(i) The anomalous expansion of water helps in
preserving the aquatic life during the very cold
weather

In cold weather (or winter), when the
atmospheric temperature starts falling well
below 0°C, water at the surface of a pond (or
lake) initially at temperature above 4°C, begins
to radiate heat to the atmosphere, so the
temperature of water starts falling upto 4°C.
When temperature of water at the surface falls,
water contracts, so its density increases and
therefore, it sinks to the bottom. This continues
till temperature of entire water reaches to 4°C.
Now, further cooling of top layers below 4°C
results in expansion of water and so its density
decreases. As a result, water does not sink

122


--- Page 5 ---
ATMOSPHERE BELOW 0°C

ICE AT 0°C

Fig. 6.5 Formation of ice at the top in a pond

further, but it remains on the surface. When the
temperature of atmosphere falls below 0°C,
water on the surface rejects heat to the
atmosphere and gradually freezes into ice, but
water well below the ice layer remains at 4°C.
The water layer just below the ice in contact
with it will be at 0°C. Fig. 6.5 shows the
formation of ice at the surface of pond (or
lake). Since ice is a poor conductor of heat, so
ice now prevents the flow of heat from water
of pond (or lake) to the atmosphere. Thus
temperature of water in contact with ice is at

0°C, while the temperature of water layers
below the ice gradually increases to 4°C. As a
result, fish and other aquatic creatures remain
alive in water of the pond (or lake), though
water on the surface has frozen into ice. Nature
thus protects the aquatic life during the winter
season. .

(ii) The anomalous expansion of water is
responsible for the burst of water pipe lines, and
destruction of crop during the very cold nights

In winter nights, as the atmospheric
temperature starts falling below 4°C, water in
pipe lines expands and it exerts large pressure
on the pipes, causing them to burst. Plants also
die for the same reason as their capillaries burst
when water expands below 4°C.

To protect the plants, the field is filled with
water.

(B) ENERGY FLOW AND ITS IMPORTANCE

6.7 ENERGY FLOW IN AN ECOSYSTEM

A unit composed of biotic components
(i.e., producers, consumers and decomposers)
and abiotic components (i.e., light, heat, rain,
humidity, inorganic and organic substances) is
called an ecosystem.

The existence of living beings such as
plants and animals depends on the flow of
energy in them. Energy is needed for all the
biotic activities. The most significant source of
energy for all ecosystems is the sun.

The energy received on the earth from the
sun is utilised in different ways. Nearly 56-60%
part of the incident energy is absorbed by the
atmosphere, nearly 10% is utilised in heating of
water and land, and only 8% falls on plants.
Plants absorb most of the energy falling on
them. Out of the absorbed energy, plants use
only 0-02% in photosynthesis for producing
their food. They are called the producers.

Food chain : In ecosystem, photosynthetic
plants and bacteria act as producers. The food
synthesized by producers is utilised by primary
consumers (such as krill). The primary
consumers are eaten by the secondary consumers
(such as small fish) and in turn they are
consumed by the tertiary consumers (such as
large fish). The tertiary consumers may be eaten
by man. The man may be the last consumer in

this chain of energy transfer when he eats the
fish. This simple food chain is shown in Fig. 6.6.

Energy flow Fig. 6.7 shows the
energy flow in the ecosystem. The producers
(photosynthetic plants) synthesize organic
substances by the process of photosynthesis (i.e.,
they bind the simple compounds with the help
of solar energy into the complex organic
substances). The chemical energy so stored in
plants is called the gross primary production.
The producers themselves first use the

synthesized organic substances in the process of
respiration in which some energy is used in
oxidation of organic substances. The rest of the
energy, called the net primary production, is
stored for the growth, development and
important metabolic processes. In Fig. 6.7, the
gross primary production by the producers is
20,810 cal energy, out of which 11,977 cal
energy is used in the respiration and the net
primary production is 8,833 cal energy.

Fig. 6.7 Energy flow in ecosystems

Next the primary consumers (herbivores)
obtain their food from the producers, so they
obtain only a small part of energy from the
producers and the rest is wasted in decay of
producers. A small part of the energy obtained by
the primary consumers is utilized in respiration
through which they perform metabolic processes
of their body and the remaining part is stored in
them as food. In Fig. 6.7, the primary consumers
obtain only 3,368 cal energy from the producers
and rest of the energy 5,465 cal is wasted in their
decay. Then out of 3,368 cal energy which the
primary consumers obtain from the producers,
1,890 cal energy is used up in respiration and
1,478 cal energy is stored as food.

Afterwards, a small part of the energy stored
as food in the primary consumers is obtained by

the secondary consumers (carnivores). They again
make use of a part of the energy in respiration and
rest is stored in them as food. In Fig. 6.7, the
secondary consumers obtain only 383 cal energy
from the primary consumers and rest of the
energy 1,095 cal is wasted in their decay. The
secondary consumers utilise 316 cal energy in
respiration and rest of the energy 67 cal is stored
in them as food.

By repeating the sequence, the tertiary
consumers (carnivores) obtain energy as food
from the secondary consumers and utilise a small
part of it in respiration and remaining energy is
wasted in their decay and decomposition. In
Fig. 6.7, the tertiary consumers obtain only 21 cal
energy from the secondary consumers and rest of
the energy (i.e., 46 cal) is wasted in their decay.
Out of the 21 cal energy obtained by the tertiary
consumers, 15 cal energy is used in respiration
and 6 cal energy is wasted in their decay.

The energy flow in ecosystems is thus linear
i.e., it moves in a fixed direction. At the end, the
energy reaches to the degraded (or unuseful) state.

be understood in form of a food chain shown
in Fig. 6.8.

6.8 APPLICATION OF LAWS OF

THERMODYNAMICS IN ENERGY

FLOW

The flow of energy in the process of entrance,
transformation and diffusion in ecosystem is
governed by the laws of thermodynamics.

According to the first law of thermodynamics,
the energy can be transformed from one form to the
other form, but it can neither be created nor
destroyed. When certain amount of one form of

energy is destroyed, then fhe same amount of another
form of energy is created as shown in Fig. 6.7
According to the second law of thermo-
dynamics, when energy is put to work, a part of
it is always converted in unuseful form as heat
mainly, due to friction and radiation. In all such
cases the total sum of useful and unuseful energy
remains constant. In Fig. 6.7, the energy used in
respiration and in decay (or death) appears as
unuseful heat energy because this energy does
not reach to the consumer of next stage. So just
like a machine, in ecosystem also the energy
transfer is not 100% efficient, a portion of the
transferred energy always goes to unuseful form
in accordance with the second law of

thermodynamics.

(C) ENERGY SOURCES

6.9 SOURCES OF ENERGY

We require energy in every activity of our
life. For example, energy is required to cook
food, to light homes, to run gadgets, to move
vehicles, to run T.V., cinema, radio, etc. We
need energy for production in factories and also
for crops in fields. To meet most of these
requirements, the energy needed is in form of
heat and electricity. For example, we need heat
energy for cooking food and this heat energy is
obtained by burning the fuels such as coal,
wood, kerosene or cooking gas. We need
electricity to run electric motors, fans, etc. and
it is obtained from coal, hydro-energy or
nuclear energy.

Characteristics of a source of energy : A
source of energy should be such that it can
provide an adequate amount of useful energy at
a steady rate over a long period of time. It should
be safe and convenient to use, economical and
easy to store and transport.

Classification of sources of energy : From
the point of view of availability, the energy
sources are divided into the following two groups:

(1) renewable or non-conventional sources
of energy, and
non-renewable or conventional sources
of energy.

6.10 RENEWABLE OR THE NON-
CONVENTIONAL SOURCES OF
ENERGY

(2)

A natural source providing us energy
continuously is called a renewable (or non-
conventional) source of energy. Sun is the main
source of energy for us on the earth. The energy
harnessed from the natural sources like wind,
flowing water, tides, ocean waves and biogas is
directly or indirectly derived from the energy of
the sun. We can use these sources as long as
the earth continues to receive heat and light
from the sun. Apart from these sources, geo-
thermal energy and nuclear energy are the other
sources of energy which can provide us energy
over a long period of time. These sources of

energy can be used again and again and will
never get exhausted.

Although the wood, obtained from trees, is
also considered a renewable source of energy,
but trees usually take more than 15 years to
grow fully, therefore, renewal of wood as source
of energy takes a long time. Further, cutting of
trees on a large scale causes depletion of
forests which results in global warming and
environmental imbalance. Hence use of wood as
a source of energy must be avoided.

Thus, the main sources of renewable energy
are : (i) Sun (ii) Wind (iii) Flowing water
(Hydro) (iv) Bio mass and bio fuels from waste
(v) Tides (vi) Oceans (vii) Geo-thermal spots
and (viii) Nuclear fuel.

(i) Sun as source of energy : Sun is the
main source of various types of energy. The
energy obtained from sun is called the ‘solar
energy. In the interior of the sun, nuclear fusion
reactions generate huge amount of energy which
is radiated out continuously in all directions in
space. Since the sun is very far from the earth,
we receive only a very small fraction of the
total solar energy.

The solar energy that reaches earth is
neither uniform nor equal at all places. It
changes daily even at one place. It also varies
during a day. The average solar energy reaching
the upper atmosphere of earth per second on an
area of 1 metre? is called the solar constant and
it is estimated to be nearly 1-34 kW m™~. The
solar energy reaching the earth is absorbed by
land, plants and water bodies like rivers, lakes
and oceans. The solar energy absorbed by land
and water bodies cause winds, storms, rains,
snow falls and sea waves, etc. while the solar
energy absorbed by plants is utilized by them in
preparing their food by the process of
photosynthesis.

(ii) Wind as source of energy : The
large mass of moving air is called wind. Due
to motion, it has kinetic energy. The kinetic
energy of wind is called the wind energy.

127


--- Page 10 ---
Indirectly wind energy comes trom Solar
energy. The sun rays falling on earth heat
different areas of earth unequally. Due to
(i) unequal heating of different areas of earth,
(iil) rotation of earth and (iii) local convection
currents, we have different wind cycles.

From the very early days, we have been
using energy possessed by wind for various
purposes such as in removing husk from grains,
in propelling sail boats in rivers and seas, in
moving vehicles for transportation and in
windmills to draw water from the ground and
to grind grains.

(iii) Flowing water as a source of energy:
The kinetic energy possessed by the flowing
water is called the hydro energy.

Hydro energy too comes indirectly from the
sun. The solar energy is responsible for water
cycle in nature. Water in oceans, rivers, lakes,
etc. absorbs solar energy and it then evaporates
to form clouds. The clouds move due to air
currents and ultimately water comes back on
earth in the form of rain and snow.

Man has been utilizing for centuries the
energy of flowing water in rivers for rotating
the wheels of water mill used to drive the flour
mill in remote hilly areas and for transporting
heavy logs of wood from forests in hilly areas
to the downstream areas in planes.

(iv) Bio mass as source of energy : The
wastes and dead parts of living beings like
plants, trees and animals, is called bio mass.
They contain carbon compounds. The chemical
energy stored in the bio mass is called the bio
energy. Thus, bio energy also comes from solar
energy. Bio mass such as wood, cattle dung,
crop residues and agriculture wastes like
bagasse have been traditionally used as fuel to
produce heat energy for domestic as well as
commercial purposes.

Bio mass is also used to produce bio gas
by its decomposition in the absence of oxygen.
The main constituent of bio gas is methane
(65%) and rest is a mixture of carbon dioxide,
hydrogen and hydrogen sulphide. Bio gas is
used as a fuel to run engines and for generating

electricity. In India, we uSe two types of bio gas
plants : (1) the floating gas holder type and
(2) the fixed dome type. They are also called
Gobar gas plants because the main bio mass
used in these plants is called slurry which is
the mixture of animal dung (or gobar) in water.

(v) Tides as source of energy : The rise
of ocean water near the coast is called high tide
and fall of ocean water is called low tide. This
rise and fall of tidal waves occur twice a day
in oceans. The energy possessed by rising and
falling water in tides is known as tidal energy.

Tidal energy is harnessed for producing
electricity by constructing a dam across a
narrow opening to the sea. But this is not a
major source of energy because of the following
two reasons :

(1) The rise and fall of sea water during
tides is not enough to generate
electricity on a large scale.

(2) There are very few sites which are
suitable for building the tidal dams.

(vi) Oceans as source of energy :
Water in oceans possesses energy in two
forms (a) ocean thermal energy and
(b) oceanic (or sea) waves energy.

(a) Ocean thermal energy : Water at the
surface of an ocean gets heated by absorbing
the heat of sun, while water at its deeper levels
remains cold. Thus, there is a difference in
temperature of water at the surface and at
deeper levels of an ocean. This difference in
temperature is found to be up to 20°C. The
energy available due to the difference in
temperature of water at the surface and at
deeper levels of ocean is called the ocean
thermal energy (OTE). Obviously, this energy
also comes indirectly from the sun.

Ocean thermal energy is harnessed for
producing electricity by a device called ocean
thermal energy conversion power plant
(OCTEC power plant).

(b) Oceanic (or sea) waves energy : Due
to the wind blowing on the surface of oceans,
waves move at high speed on its surface which
are called the oceanic waves (or sea waves). Due

128


--- Page 11 ---
to their high speed, they carry tremendous
amount of kinetic energy with them. Thus, the
kinetic energy possessed by such fast moving
oceanic (or sea) waves is called the oceanic (or
sea) waves energy. This energy also comes
indirectly from the sun.

Sea waves energy can also be harnessed to
produce electricity, but so far it has not become
possible to produce electricity from sea waves
energy on a large scale. However, models have
been made to generate electricity from oceanic
waves.

(vii) Geo thermal spots as source of
energy : At some places, rocks below the surface
of earth are very hot. Such places are known as
hot spots. The heat energy possessed by rocks
inside the earth is called the geo thermal energy.

Geo thermal energy is harnessed to produce
electricity. The rocks present at hot spots, heat
the underground water and turn it into steam,
which gets compressed at high pressure between
the rocks. By drilling holes into the earth up
to the hot spots, steam is extracted through
pipes which is utilized to rotate the turbine
connected to the armature of an electric
generator to produce electricity.

In India, there are very few places where
geothermal energy is harnessed to produce
electricity. One such place is in Madhya
Pradesh. However, in USA and Newzealand,
there are a number of geo thermal energy based
power plants.

(viii) Nuclear fuel as source of energy :
When uranium nucleus is bombarded with a
slow neutron, it splits into two nearly equal
light nuclei and a large amount of energy is
released. This phenomenon is called nuclear
fission, Similarly, when two light nuclei
combine to form a heavy nucleus at a very high
_ temperature. (= 10’ K) and high pressure, a
tremendous amount of energy is released. This
phenomenon is called nuclear fusion. In both
these processes, the origin of energy is the loss
in mass i.e., the sum of masses of the products
of reaction is less than the sum of masses of
reactants and this loss in mass is converted into

energy E according to the Ejinstein’s mass-
energy equivalence relation E = mc*, where
c (=3 x 108 m s-!) is the speed of light and m
is the loss in mass. This energy is known as
nuclear energy.

In fission reaction of one uranium nucleus,
nearly 200 MeV energy is released and two or
three neutrons are also emitted. If number of
uranium nuclei present are more, each neutron
emitted in the fission reaction of a uranium
nucleus causes fission in the new uranium
nuclei and thus a chain of nuclear fission
reactions occurs, which once started continues
till the entire uranium is exhausted. As a result
of such an uncontrolled chain reaction, more
and more energy is produced which may cause
an explosion. An atom bomb is based on this
principle. But to utilize the energy produced in
the process of fission for constructive use (such
as to produce electricity), the chain reaction is
controlled by absorbing some neutrons with the
help of cadmium rods. This is done in a
nuclear reactor.

So far it has not become possible to harness
energy by the process of nuclear fusion.

6.11 NON-RENEWABLE OR
CONVENTIONAL SOURCES
ENERGY

The sources of energy which have
accumulated in nature over a very long period
and cannot be quickly replaced when exhausted,
are called the non-renewable or conventional
sources of energy. Coal, petroleum and natural
gas known as fossil fuels are non-renewable
sources. They are formed by the decomposition
of the remains of plants and animals buried
under the earth, millions of years ago. Thus, the
formation of fossil fuels have occurred over
millions of years due to certain very slow
changes under special circumstances. If they are
being used extensively, their known reserves
will soon deplete and once exhausted, they
cannot be regenerated soon.

THE
OF

The common non-renewable sources of
energy are : (i) coal, (ii) petroleum and
(iii) natural gas.

FO 129


--- Page 12 ---
(i) Coal : Coal is a non-renewable source
made up of complex compounds of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen along with some free
carbon and compounds of nitrogen and sulphur.
It is found in deep mines under the surface of
earth. In India, coal mines are found in
Jharkhand, West Bengal, Orissa and
Chattishgarh. Since coal is found in abundance

-in our country, it is the most common source
of energy for us.

(ii) Petroleum : Petroleum is a dark
coloured viscous liquid also called crude oil. It
is a non-renewable source of energy which is
found under the earth’s crust trapped in rocks.
It is called petroleum because petroleum means
rock oil. /t is a complex mixture of many
hydrocarbons with water, salt, earth particles
and other compounds of carbon, oxygen,
nitrogen and sulphur. It is lighter than water
and does not mix with it. Petroleum is obtained
by drilling oil wells into the earth’s crust at its
reservoirs. In India, the reservoirs of petroleum
have been found in Assam and Mumbai.

The crude petroleum extracted from wells
is not suitable to be used as a fuel in its natural
form. It has to be purified (or refined) to obtain
different useful components. The process of

_ separating useful components from crude

petroleum is called refining which is done by
fractional distillation in big oil refineries set up
for this purpose.

The petroleum gas obtained as a by-product
from the fractional distillation of petroleum
contains mainly the butane and a small amount
of propane and ethane. These gases burn readily
and produce a lot of heat. Hence the petroleum
gas can be used as a good fuel.

Butane, propane and ethane are in gaseous
states at ordinary pressure, but they can be
easily liquefied under pressure. The petroleum
gas liquefied under pressure is called the
liquefied petroleum gas (or LPG) which is used
in domestic gas stoves as fuel for heating
purposes. It is stored in gas cylinders after
mixing a strong smelling substance called ethyl
mercaptan (C,H,SH) so that the gas leakage, if
any, from the cylinder can easily be detected.

(iii) Natural gas : Natural gas is also a
non-renewable source of energy which is found
deep under the earth’s crust either alone or
above the petroleum reservoirs. It is also
obtained by digging wells into the earth. From
some wells we can extract only the natural gas,
while from others both the natural gas and
petroleum. In India, there are a number of
natural gas fields such as in Tripura, Jaisalmer,
off shore area of Mumbai and in the Krishna-
Godavari delta. The main component of natural
gas is methane (up to 95%) along with small
quantities of ethane and propane. It easily burns
to produce heat.

6.12 JUDICIOUS USE OF ENERGY

It is not possible to harness energy sufficent
for our requirement from the non-conventional
sources, so we have to make use..of the
conventional sources also. But the conventional
sources of energy (i.e., fossil fuels) are limited
and non-renewable, so the constant use of them
will create an energy crisis in the coming
future. Therefore the following measures must
be taken for the judicious use of energy.

(1) The fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum,
etc. should be used only for limited

130


--- Page 13 ---
purposes when no other alternative
source of energy is available.

(2) Wastage of energy should be avoided.

(3) Cutting of trees must be banned and
more and more trees should be planted.

(4) Efforts must be made to make use of
energy in community (or groups).

(5) The use of energy in urban areas is
much more than in the rural areas. In
rural areas, the use of renewable sources
of energy is easier than in urban areas.
In rural areas, we can use bio gas, wind
energy, hydro energy for running lights
and tube wells.

(6) Such techniques should be developed
by which in near future, we may make
use of the renewable sources such as
solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy.
bio energy, ocean energy, etc. as much
as possible to meet our requirements.

(7) Efforts must be made to obtain nuclear
energy by the controlled nuclear fusion
of deuterium nuclei present in heavy
water available in sea. This will then
become an endless source of energy.

In our daily life both in urban and rural
area, we need energy mostly in form of
electricity, so we shall now study the methods
of producing electricity from the renewable
sources of energy.

6.13 PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY
FROM SOLAR ENERGY

The sun is the most vast and direct source
of energy. To obtain electricity from the solar
energy, two devices are used : a solar cell
and a solar power plant. The device which
converts solar energy directly into the electricity
is called a solar cell. On the other hand, a
solar heating device used to generate electricity
from solar energy, is called a solar power
plant.

(i) Solar cell : About a hundred years ago,
it was discovered that when sunlight falls on a
thin layer of selenium, an electric current is
produced. Since only 0-6% of the solar energy
incident on selenium could convert into electric

energy, So no serious efforts were then made to
produce electricity from solar energy. The first
solar cell was made in 1954 which had an
efficiency of only 1%. But nowadays solar cells
have been made with an efficiency of up to
30%.

The solar cells are usually made from
semiconductors like silicon and gallium. A
semiconductor has conductivity less than that of
a metal, but more than that of an insulator. At
ordinary temperature, a semiconductor has a
very low conductivity, but its conductivity
increases either with the rise in temperature or
when some impurities are added in it. If
sunlight is made incident on an impurity added
semiconductor, a potential difference is
produced between its surfaces. This forms a
solar cell. Due to this potential difference, a
current flows in the circuit connected between
the opposite faces of the semiconductor. Such
a single solar cell of area 4 cm? produces a
potential difference of nearly 0-4 volt to 0-5 volt
due to which a current of nearly 60 milli-
ampere can be obtained. To increase the
efficiency, a large number of such cells are
arranged over a large area so that they could
collect a large amount of solar energy to
produce sufficient electricity. Such an
arrangement of solar cells is called a solar
panel. ,

A solar panel gives electricity so long as
sunlight is falling on it. Therefore a solar panel
cannot produce electricity at night. To overcome
this difficulty, the storage battery (or secondary
cell) is charged by a solar panel during the day
time and it can then be used at night to provide
electricity. The solar panels are used to supply
electricity in the artificial satellites and for

--- Page 14 ---
“running water pumps, street ughting, radio and
television sets in remote, inaccessible and
isolated areas where conventional sources of
energy are not available. Small solar cells are
used in watches and calculators. Fig. 6.9 shows
a solar panel used for running a water pump.

Advantages of using solar panels :

1. They do not require any maintenance.

2. They last over a long period of time.

3. Their running cost is almost nil.

4. They are most suitable for the remote,
inaccessible, and isolated places where
electric power lines cannot be laid.

5. They do not cause any pollution in the
environment.

Disadvantages of using solar panels :

1. The initial cost of a solar panel is sufficiently
high.

2. The efficiency of conversion of solar energy
to electricity is low.

3. A solar panel produces d.c. electricity which
cannot be directly used for many household
purposes.

(ii) Solar power plant : A solar power
plant is a device in which heat energy of sun
is used to generate electricity. The sun rays after
reflection from a large concave reflector get
concentrated at its focus. The rays have
sufficient heat energy which can boil water, if
it is placed at the focus of the reflector. This
principle is used in a solar power plant.

A solar power plant consists of a number of
big concave reflectors, at the focus of which there
are black painted water pipes. The reflectors
concentrate the heat energy of sun rays on the
pipes due to which water inside the pipes starts
boiling and produces steam. The steam thus
produced is used to rotate a steam turbine which
drives a generator producing electricity. Such a
solar power plant of capacity 50 kW has been
installed at Gurgaon in Haryana.

6.14 PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY
FROM WIND ENERGY

Nowadays wind energy is used in a wind
generator to produce electricity by making use

of a windmill (or wind turbine) to drive a wind
generator.
Armature
= Electric generator (dynamo)

Fig. 6.10 Wind generator

Fig. 6.10 shows a wind generator in which a
small electric generator (or dynamo) is placed at
the top of a pillar. The armature of the dynamo is
connected to the shaft attached with the blades
of a wind mill. When the blowing wind strikes
the blades of the wind mill (or turbine), the kinetic
energy of wind changes into the rotational kinetic
energy of the blades. The rotation of blades of
the turbine rotates the armature of the dynamo in
the magnetic field between the pole pieces N and
S of a strong magnet, thus an alternating e.m.f. is
produced between the terminals T, and T,.

The electric power generated by a single wind
mill generator is small. So to generate a sufficient
amount of electric power, a large number of such
wind generators are arranged over a big area
called a wind farm, and then the electric power
generated by each generator is combined together
for supply to the consumers. At present in India,
we are generating more than 1025 MW electric
power by this technique in coastal areas of
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. It is planned to produce
electric power up to 20,000 MW in our country
by the use of wind energy.

Advantages of using the wind energy : (i) It
does not cause any kind of pollution. (ii) It is an
everlasting (i.e., renewable) source.
Limitations of using the wind energy : (i) The
wind farms can be established only at places near
the coastal areas where wind blows around the
year steadily with a speed not less than 15 km h7!.
(ii) A large area of land is needed for, the
establishment of a wind farm. (iii) The
establishment of a wind farm is expensive.

6.15 PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY
FROM WATER (or hydro) ENERGY

The most important use of hydro energy is to

132


--- Page 15 ---
convert it into the electrical energy by using a
turbine. The electricity so obtained is called the
hydroelectric power.

River water

Armature
Fig. 6.11 Hydroelectric plant

Fig. 6.11 shows the principle of a
hydroelectric power plant. The flowing water of
river is collected in a dam at high altitude. The
water stored in the dam has the potential energy.
When water from dam falls on the water turbine,
the potential energy of the water stored in dam
changes into its kinetic energy and this kinetic
energy of water is transferred to the blades of
turbine as the rotational kinetic energy. As the
turbine rotates, it rotates the armature of the
generator (or dynamo) in the magnetic field
between the pole pieces N and S of a strong
magnet, due to which an alternating e.m-f. is
produced between the terminals 7, and T,. Such
a mini hydroelectric power plant can be
constructed on the rivers in hilly areas across a
small dam of height nearly 10 m. At present in
India we are generating hydro-electricity which
is only 23% of the total electricity generated
by us. However, it is planned to produce nearly

4 x 10!! kWh electrical energy from the hydro

Advantages of using the hydro energy :
(i) It does not produce any environmental
pollution. (ii) It is a renewable source of energy.
(iit) The dams constructed over rivers help us in

+, utigation and control of floods in rivers.
1

Limitations of using hydro energy : (i) The
flowing water is not available every where.
(ii) Due to the construction of dams over the
rivers, plants and animals of that place get
destroyed or killed. (iii) The ecological balance
in the downstream areas of rivers gets disturbed.

6.16 PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY
FROM NUCLEAR ENERGY

It is possible to produce electricity from the
nuclear energy by the controlled chain reaction
of nuclear fission of a radioactive substance like
uranium-235 (or plutonium-239). The set up used
is called the nuclear power plant.

Fig. 6.12 shows the arrangment of a nuclear
power plant in which the main part is the nuclear
reactor. In a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction
of nuclear fission of uranium-235 (or plutonium-
239) is controlled by the cadmium rods. The heat
energy released in the process, is absorbed by
the coolant which then passes through the coils
of a heat exchanger containing water. The water
in heat exchanger gets heated and converts into
steam. The steam is used to rotate the turbine

--- Page 16 ---
which in turn rotates the armature of a generator
in a magnetic field and thus electricity is
produced.

In India, we have four nuclear power plants :
(i) at Tarapur in Maharashtra, (ii) at Rana Pratap
Sagar near Kota in Rajasthan, (iii) at Kalpakkam
in Tamil Nadu and (iv) at Narora in Uttar Pradesh,
where electricity is generated by the use of
nuclear energy. At present only about 3% of the
total electrical power generated in India is
obtained from the nuclear power plants.

Advantages of using the nuclear energy :
(i) A very small amount of nuclear fuel (such as
uranium-235) can produce a tremendous amount
of energy. (ii) Once the nuclear fuel is loaded
into a nuclear power plant, it continues to release
energy over a long period.

Limitation of use of nuclear energy : (i) It
is not a clean source of energy because very
harmful nuclear radiations are produced in the
process which are highly energetic and
penetrating. These radiations cause ionisation and
are very harmful to the human body, so a high
standard of protection is needed for the persons
working in the power plant and also for the
environment. (ii) The waste obtained from the
nuclear power plants causes a high degree of
environmental pollution.

6.17 ENERGY DEGRADATION

In our daily life we require to transform one
form of energy to the other required form of
energy. By the law of conservation of energy, the
given form of energy must be completely
converted into the desired useful form without
any loss of it. In practice, it has been observed
that in transformation of energy from one form
to the other desired form, the entire energy does
not change into the desired form, but a part of it
changes either to some other undesirable form
(usually heat due to friction) or is lost to the
surroundings due to radiation which is not useful.
This conversion of energy to the undesirable (or
non-useful) form is called the dissipation of
energy. Since this part of energy is not available
to us for any productive purpose, so we call this
as the degraded form of energy. With more and

more use of energy, the degraded form of energy
will gradually increase, while the energy available
for productive purpose will gradually decrease
(since total energy remains constant).

The gradual decrease of useful energy due to
radiation loss, friction, etc. is called the

degradation of energy.

Examples :

(i) When we light a bulb using electricity, less
than 25% of the electrical energy converts
into the light energy. The remaining part of
electrical energy changes into the heat in the
filament and the other invisible radiations.
This energy is ultimately imparted to the
atmosphere in the form of vibrational
kinetic energy of air molecules. The energy
in this form is not useful to us.

When we run a vehicle, only a part of
energy obtained from its fuel is used up in

running the vehicle, major part of it is
wasted in heating the moving parts of
machine, in doing work against friction

between the ground and its tyres and in the
form of sound.

(iit) When we cook food over a fire, the major
part of heat energy obtained from the fuel
is radiated out in the atmosphere. This
radiated energy is of no use to us. It is thus
the degraded form of energy.

When electrical appliances are run by

electricity, an appreciable part of electrical

energy is wasted in the form of heat energy.

In transmission of electricity from the power

generating station, a lot of electrical energy

is wasted in the form of heat energy in the
line wires used for transmission.

All machines have efficiency less than 1,

which implies that only a fraction of input

energy is used for doing useful work and rest
of the input energy is wasted or goes to the
degraded form.

From the above examples, we conclude that in

all processes of transfer of available form of

energy to the useful form, a good fraction of
energy changes to the non-productive or
degraded form.

In 1824, Joseph Fourier discovered the green

planet's surface and its lower atmosphere by
absorption of infrared radiations of long

wavelength emitted out from the surface of
planet.

The solar radiations coming from sun have

high energy radiations such as gamma rays,
X-rays, ultra-violet rays and low energy radiations

135


--- Page 18 ---
such as visible light, infrared radiation and radio
waves. Our earth's atmosphere is transparent only
for visible light and infrared radiation of short
wavelength. Gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet rays
are absorbed by the ozone layer surrounding the
earth while infrared radiation of long wavelength
and radio waves are reflected back into the space
by the uppermost layer of earth's atmosphere i.e.,
ionosphere and the polar ice-caps.

The solar radiations which travel through the
atmosphere of the earth, are absorbed by the
clouds, earth's surface and sea water due to which
earth's surface gets heated up. Now earth's surface
radiates infrared radiations of long wavelength.
For these radiations, the earth's atmosphere is
opaque, so they are reflected back by the clouds
and are absorbed by the gases present above the
earth's surface Thus the clouds and gases prevent
the long wavelength infrared radiation from
escaping into the space, and keeps the earth's
surface warm. Fig. 6.13 shows the green house
effect.

The gases which are the good absorber of
long wavelength infrared radiation are called the
green house gases. They are : carbon dioxide, water
vapours, methane and chlorofluorocarbons. These
gases contribute in trapping the heat energy within
the atmosphere. The naturally occuring green
house gases have an average warming effect of
nearly 33°C so that the average temperature on
earth's surface is about 15-5°C (or 60°F). In
absence of the green house gases in atmosphere,
entire heat energy radiated from the earth's surface
and objects on it, would escape out into the space
and then the average temperature on earth would

be —18°C (or O°F) instead of being 15-5°C (or
60°F). On the other hand, if there is an increase in
proportion of green house gases in atmosphere,
the average temperature on earth will rise and it
will be above 15-5°C (or 60°F).

Future projections : In the recent decades,
it has been observed that the effective
temperature of earth’s surface has risen by
0-74 + 0-18°C per decade for the last 50 years
since 1900. The rate of increase is 2-5°C per
decade (nearly three times since 1970) and since
2000, it is much more. So it is expected that by
the end of this century, the earth’s temperature
will rise up to 64°C. The reason for this is the
increase in the proportion of the green house
gases present in the earth’s atmosphere. Due to
their increase, more heat radiations radiated from
the earth’s surface are trapped in its atompshere.
It is believed that the human activities are
responsible for the increase in the green house
gas namely the carbon dioxide in the earth’s
atmosphere. The main human activities
responsible for increase of the carbon dioxide
gas are given below:

(i) The burning of fuels, deforestation,
transportation and industrial production
(particularly cement factories).

Increase of population (human beings emit
nearly 32 giga tonnes of carbon dioxide
each year).

Imbalance of carbon dioxide cycle (the
ocean does not absorb full amount of
carbon dioxide and the vegetables are not
able to change all the carbon dioxide into
oxygen).

The increase in the concentration of carbon
dioxide due to above human activities is
responsible for 60% increase in green house
effect. Apart from this, rice cultivation, animal
husbandry, natural gas exploration, burning of
bio-mass in clearing of forests and leakage in
natural gas pipe line has doubled the
concentration of methane which is also
responsible for the increase in green house effect.

Thus, the increase in green house gases in
the atmosphere enhances the green house effect
and this causes the global warming.

6.19 GLOBAL WARMING

Global warming means the increase in
average effective temperature near the earth's
surface due to an increase in the amount of
green house gases in its atmosphere.

Our earth gets heated up due to absorption
of visible and short wavelength infrared radiations
received from the sun. The green house gases,
namely the carbon dioxide, water vapours,
methane and chlorofluorocarbons, trap the
infrared radiations of long wavelength emitted
from the earth's surface and thus keep the earth's
surface warm at an average temperature of
15-5°C. It has been observed in recent decades
that over a period of 50 years in the 20th century,
the average temperature of earth's atmosphere has
risen at a rate of 0-74 + 0-18°C per decade. Now
the rate of increase of temperature of earth's
atmosphere is much more and it is expected that
the earth's average temperature will reach to 64°C
by the year 2100. An increase in average
temperature of the earth implies an increase in the
amount of green house gases present in its
atmosphere so that they could trap more heat
radiated from the earth's surface. It is believed
that the human activities such as burning of fossil
fuels, industrial growth, clearing of forests, use of
automobiles etc., have played a significant role in
increasing the green house gases (particularly
carbon dioxide) in the earth atmosphere.

Cause of global warming : The cause of
global warming is the increase in concentration
of green house gases present in the atmosphere
of earth due to human activities. The increase
in different green house gases is as follows :

(i) The concentration of carbon dioxide has
increased up to 25% due to industrial
growth, combustion of fossil fuels,
clearing of forests etc.

(ii) The concentration of methane has doubled
due to agricultural sources such as rice
cultivation and animal husbandry, natural
gas exploration, burning of biomass,
clearing of forests and leakage in natural
gas pipe lines.

(iii) The concentration of chlorofluorocarbons
has increased at a rate of 5% per year.

Thus increase in green house gases in
atmosphere enhances the green house effect and
hence causes global warming.

Impacts of global warming on life on the
earth :

The increase in proportion of green house
gases in the atmosphere has the following impacts
on the life on earth :

(1) The variable changes in the climate in
different parts of the world which has
created difficulties and forced the people and
animals to migrate from one place to the
other.

The change in blooming season of
different plants.

The change in regional climate which has
an immediate effect on simple organisms
and plants.

(4) The change in the world’s ecology.

(5) The increase in the heat stroke deaths.

Future predictions : With the present rate
of increase of green house effect and global
warming, it is predicted that the average
temperature of earth’s surface will become 64°C
by the end of the year 2100. Although it is not
possible to make very accurate predictions on
its impact for the future, but still looking at the
changes in some natural phenomenon which we
are facing now, following predictions can be
made.

(2)

(3)

(1) Dislocation and disappearance of
plant and animal species : At the present rate
of increase of green house effect, it is expected
that nearly 30% of the plant and animal species
will vanish by the year 2050 and up to 70% by
the end of the year 2100. This will disrupt
ecosystem. The animals from the equatorial
region will shift to higher latitude in search of
ice and cold region. The absorption of carbon
dioxide by ocean will cause acidification due to
which marine species will migrate.

(2) Warming of ocean : The temperature of
ocean water will increase due to which many
species in the ocean will either die or they will
disappear, while various other species which
prefer warm water will increase tremendously.

137

(3) Melting of glacier : Due to global
warming, the frozen tundra in Siberia has started
melting. Greenland has experienced 32 glacial
earth quakes in one year. The Arctic snow cover
is expected to be ice-free by the end of September
2037. The global average sea level has risen at a
rate of 3-1 mm per year. This rate of rise is
expected to increase in future. It is also expected
that the amount of oxygen dissolved in ocean will
decrease which will have adverse effect on the
marine life.

(4) Shift in farming region : In the near
future, warming of nearly 3°C will result in poor
yield in farms in low latitude regions and will
increase the rise of malnutrition. The crop yield
is expected to increase in middle and high latitude
regions. Therefore farmers will have to shift their
farming region from low latitude to high latitude.

(5) Increase in new diseases and heat
related deaths : Due to global warming, many
new diseases will emerge because bacteria can
survive better in increased temperature and they
can multiply faster. It will extend the distribution
of mosquitoes due to increase in humidity levels
and their frequent growth in warmer atmosphere.
This will result in increase of many new diseases.
Apart from it, the deaths due to heat stroke will
also increase.

(6) Change in regional climate : It is
expected that the warming over land will increase
and it will be maximum at high northern latitudes
while minimum over the southern ocean. The
frequency of hot extremes, heat waves and heavy
precipitation will also increase.

(7) Variable changes in the climate : The
variable changes in the climate will result in
increase in the number of people suffering from
death diseases and injuries from floods, storms
and droughts.

(8) Increase in cost of air conditioning : Due
to warming effect, the cost of air conditioning will
increase as it will consume more electric energy.

(9) Change in sea level : Due to melting of
ice, the area of sea ice around both the poles is
shrinking. It is expected that in the next 50 years,
the ice at both the poles will melt completely and
therefore the sea level will rise. Buildings and

roads in the coastal areas will get flooded and they
could suffer damage from hurricans and tropical
storms.

6.20 WAYS TO MINIMISE THE IMPACT
OF GLOBAL WARMING

To minimise the impact of global warming,
following three main measures must be taken :
(1) Technological measures, (2) Economic
measures and (3) Policy measures. These
measures are inter-related and must be taken
simultaneously.

(1) Technological measures

The economic growth and population growth,
each increases consumption of fuel and hence
both are responsible for the release of green house
gases. We need to check them and use the
following three technological measures :

(a) Use of renewable sources of energy
to generate electricity in place of generating
electricity from the fossil fuels based power
plants, (b) Change of transportation vehicles, and
(c) Use of bio-char stoves for cooking.

(a) Use of renewable sources of energy for
generation of electricity in place of electricity
from the fossil fuel based power plants : The
fossil fuel based power plants are the main
source of generation of the green house gases.
They produce nearly 21-3% of the total green
house gases. Therefore alternate energy sources
such as wind energy, solar energy, tidal energy,
geo thermal energy, etc. must be used to generate
electricity in place of fossil fuel based power
plants. The fossil fuel based power plants must
be banned.

(b) Change of transportation vehicles :
Vehicles such as lorry, truck etc. that are
presently in use for transportation are run by the
internal combustion engine and they contribute
nearly 14% of the total green house gas
emission. Such vehicles must be switched to
battery operated vehicles which will reduce
carbon dioxide emission drastically. For charging
the battery, electricity generated from renewable
sources must be used. Further the vehicles must
be used at their full capacity and the size of
vehicles must be reduced.

138

(c) Use of bio-char stoves for cooking : In
developing countries, bio-mass is mostly used for
cooking which also contributes significantly in the
increase of green house gases. For burning the
bio-mass, new technology must be used to burn
it in absence of air in a specially constructed stove
known as bio-char stove. It will release the
smokeless combustible gases methane and
hydrogen, leaving a charcoal residue which can
be buried in soil.

(2) Economic measures

The industrial growth and deforestation for
population growth have caused the increase in
green house effect. To check them, following two
economic measures are needed : (a) Reforestation
and sustainable use of land, and (b) Industries to
pay carbon tax.

(a) Reforestation and sustainable use of
land : In developing countries, the pressure of
population and industrial growth has resulted in
unsustainable agricultural practices which are
responsible for 90% of deforestation. These
countries must be asked to reforest and maintain
forest habitats. Their loss must be verified by
satellite imaging before compensating them by
the international agencies.

(b) Industries to pay carbon tax : Since
industries emit carbon dioxide to a good extent,
so to check them, they must be asked to pay
carbon tax. This tax can be calculated on the basis
of carbon emission from the industry, number of
employee hour and turn over of the industry. This
will encourage the industry to use the energy
efficient offices and to avoid the travelling of its
employees by having tele-conferencing.

(3) Policy measures

To check global warming, Government must

take the following two policy measures :
(a) Educating children to live sustainable life style,
and (b) Controlling population through family
planning, welfare reforms and the empowerment of
women.

(a) Educating children to live sustainable
life style : We need to educate children that
genuine happiness lies in a less competitive and
more cooperative society. Consuming more and
buying more must not be the aim of life. For a
sustainable life, we must make full use of what
we have. The materialistic gain gives a temporary
pleasure.

(b) Controlling population through family
planning, welfare reforms and_ the
empowerment of women : The world population
is expected to increase from 7-1 billion in the year
2012 to 9-15 billion by the year 2050 with most
of the growth taking place in the developing
countries. This needs to be controlled. Population
growth can be controlled through various
measures such as (i) free and easy access to family
planning, (ii) welfare provisions to encourage
smaller families, and (iii) the empowerment of
women through education and freedom to choose
their future career (because the educated women
are more conscious about family planning due to
their career commitments).

Recently in ‘the 21st yearly 2015 United
Nations Climate Change conference CUP21/
CMP11’ held in Paris from November 30 to
December 12, 2015 each nation has expressed a
deep concern on the present rate of increase of
green house gases and it is committed to limit the
global warming to below 2-0°C compared to
pre-industrial level by the year 2100 for which a
goal of zero carbon emission is to be achieved
between 2030 to 2050.
