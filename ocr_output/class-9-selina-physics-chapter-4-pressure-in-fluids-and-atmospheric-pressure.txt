(A) PRESSURE IN FLUIDS AND ITS TRANSMISSION

4.1 THRUST AND PRESSURE

Thrust : A force can be applied on a surface in
any direction. If a force is applied in a direction
normal (or perpendicular) to the surface, it is called
the thrust. Thus,

| Thrust ie ythe fete acting ee

surface.

The thrust exerted by a body placed on a surface
is equal to its weight. The thrust is same in whatsoever
position the body is placed on the surface. Thus,

‘Thrust exerted by a body on a surface’.

= Weight of the body’ «: ‘@ 1)

Thrust is a vector quantity.

Unit of thrust : It is measured in the units of
force. The S.I. unit of thrust is newton (N) and
C.G.S. unit of thrust is dyne, where 1 N = 10° dyne.

The gravitational unit of thrust in M.K.S.
system is kgf and in C.GS. system is gf. They are
related as :

1 kgf = 9-8 N and 1 gf = 980 dyne

Pressure : The effect of thrust depends on the
area of the surface on which it acts. The effect of a
thrust is less on a large area, while it is more on a
small area.

Example : If you stand on loose sand, your
feet sink into the sand, but if you lie on that sand,
your body does not sink into the sand. In both the
cases, the thrust exerted on the sand is same (equal
to your weight). But when you lie on sand, the thrust
acts on a larger area and when you stand, the same
thrust acts on a smaller area.

78

The effect of thrust is expressed in terms of
thrust per unit area. This quantity is called pressure.
Thus

Pressure is the thrust per unit area of surface.

If a thrust F acts on an area A, then

_ Thrust F

Pressure is a scalar quantity.

From relation (4.2), pressure =

~ Unit of _ Unit of thrust
. Unit of pressure = Ty or area

S.I. unit : The S.I. unit of thrust is newton and
that of area is metre?, so the S.I. unit of pressure is
newton per metre? which is abbreviated as N m~.
This unit is named pascal (symbol Pa) after the
name of the french scientist Blaise Pascal. i.e.,

, al 1 Pa) 1 Newton
a) =

pascal (or 1 metre”

or 1Pa=1Nm?

Thus

One pascal is the pressure exerted on a
surface of area 1 m* by a force of 1 N acting
normally on it.
However, if thrust is measured in kgf and
area in m2, the unit of pressure is kgf m=.
C.GS. unit : The C.GS. unit of pressure is
dyne cm where
0-1 Nm? or 1 Nm?

1 dyne cm? = = 10 dyne cm”.


--- Page 2 ---
If thrust is measured in gf and area in cm?, the
unit of pressure is gf cm~.

Other units : Other units of pressure are bar
and millibar, where
1 bar = 10° N m7 and 1 millibar = 10° bar = 10? N m~?.

The atmospheric pressure is generally
expressed in terms of the height of mercury column
in the barometre. At normal temperature and
pressure, the barometric height is 0-76 m of Hg (or
76 cm of Hg or 760 mm of Hg) at sea level which
is taken as one atmosphere. Thus atmospheric
pressure is also expressed in a unit atmosphere
(symbol atm) where

1 atmosphere (atm) = 0-76 m of Hg = 1-013 x 10° Pa

Sometimes we use torr as unit of atmospheric
pressure after the name of the scientist Torricelli
where

ltorr = 1 mmof Hg

latm = 760 torr.
Factors affecting the pressure : The pressure
exerted on a surface depends on two factors :
(i) the area on which the thrust is applied, and
(ii) the thrust.

Examples : (1) A brick of weight 4 kgf having
dimensions 20 cm x 10 cm x 5 cm exerts maximum
pressure on ground when it is placed with its longest
side (20 cm) vertical [Fig 4.1(a)], while it exerts
minimum pressure on ground when it is placed with
its shortest side (5 cm) vertical [Fig. 4.1(b)], even

though the thrust is same in each case.

.. Pressure on base (or ground) =

200 cm?
= 0-02 kef cm

Thus pressure on ground in Fig. 4.1(b) is
one-fourth of pressure in Fig. 4.1(a).

Obviously, larger the area on which a given
thrust acts, lesser is the pressure exerted by it.

(2) In Fig. 4.1(b), if another identical brick is
placed over the first brick, the thrust gets doubled
(= 8 kgf) and since it acts on same area of base
(= 200 cm?), so the pressure on ground becomes
=8 kef / 200 cm? = 0-04 kgf cm™ (i.e., it gets doubled).

Thus larger the thrust acting on a given area,
greater is the pressure exerted on it.

Way of increasing pressure : For the given
thrust, the pressure on a surface is increased by
reducing the area of surface.

Examples : (a) The ends of nails (or pins) are
made pointed so that large pressure is exerted at
the pointed ends and they can be driven into, with
a less effort.

(b) The cutting tools also have either sharp (or
pointed) edges so that even a small thrust may
cause a great pressure at the edges and cutting can
be done with a less effort.

Way of decreasing pressure : For the given
thrust, the pressure on a surface is reduced by
increasing the area of surface.

Examples : (a) Wide wooden sleepers are placed
below the railway tracks so that the pressure exerted
by the iron rails on the ground becomes less.

(b) The foundations of buildings are made
wider than the walls so that the pressure exerted
by the building on the ground becomes less.

4.2 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS

A substance which can flow is called a fluid.
All liquids and gases are, thus, fluids.

A solid exerts pressure on a surface due to
its weight. Similarly, a fluid also exerts pressure
due to its weight. A solid exerts pressure only on
the surface on which it is placed i.e., at its
bottom, but a fluid exerts pressure on the bottom
as well as on the walls of the container due to
its tendency to flow. A fluid, therefore, exerts
pressure in all directions. Thus,



--- Page 3 ---
Experimental demonstration : Take a vessel filled
with a liquid (say, water). Place it on a horizontal surface.
Make several small holes in the wall of the vessel anywhere
below the free surface of liquid. It is observed that :

(1) The liquid spurts out through each hole. This shows
that the liquid exerts pressure at each point on the wall
of the vessel.

If we put our finger on any of the hole, finger feels a
thrust due to liquid. This demonstrates that the liquid
contained in the vessel exerts thrust at all points below
its free surface. Thrust on unit area at a point gives the
pressure due to liquid at that point.

If we note the distance from the bottom of the vessel]
to the point where the liquid from a hole strikes on the
horizontal surface, it is noticed that as the depth of the
hole below the free surface of liquid increases, the
throw of liquid also increases i.e., the liquid reaches
to a greater distance on the horizontal surface. This
shows that liquid pressure at a point increases with
the increase of depth of point from its free surface
(Fig. 4.2).

Fig. 4.2 Liquid pressure increases with increase of
depth below the free surface

4.3 PRESSURE EXERTED BY A LIQUID
COLUMN (P = hpg)

The pressure exerted by a liquid of density p at

a depth h is P = hpg where g is the accelration due

to gravity i.e.,

Proof : Consider a vessel containing a liquid
of density p. Let the liquid be stationary. In order
to calculate pressure at a depth h, consider a
horizontal circular surface PQ of area A at depth h

LIQUID

Fig. 4.3 Pressure at a depth in a liquid

- on the free surface of liquid is

below the free surface XY of the liquid (Fig. 4.3).
The pressure on surface PQ will be due to the
weight of the liquid coloumn above the surface
PQ (i.e., the liquid contained in cylinder PORS of
height h with PQ as its base and top face RS lying
on the free surface XY of the liquid).

The thrust exerted on the surface PQ

= Weight of the liquid column PORS

= Volume of liquid column PQRS x density x g

= (Area of base PQ x height) x density x g

This thrust is exerted on the surface PQ of
area A. Therefore, pressure

Note : Since there is atmospheric pressure above
the free surface of liquid, so to find the total pressure
at a depth inside a liquid, it must also be taken into
consideration. If the atmospheric pressure acting

Factors affecting the pressure at a point in a
liquid

From eqn. (4.4), it is clear that the pressure at
a point inside the liquid depends directly on the
following three factors :

(i) depth of the point below the free

surface (h),
(ii) density of liquid (p), and
(iii) acceleration due to gravity (g).

At a particular place on the earth surface, the
acceleration due to gravity g is constant, therefore,
the pressure at a point in a liquid is (i) directly
proportional to the depth / of the point below the free
surface of the liquid, and (ii) directly proportional
to the density p of the liquid.

However, the pressure inside a liquid does not
depend on (i) the shape and size of the vessel in
which the liquid is contained, and (ii) the area of
surface on which it acts.

4.4 LAWS OF LIQUID PRESSURE

Following are the five laws of liquid pressure :

(i) Inside the liquid, pressure increases with the
increase in depth from its free surface.

80


--- Page 4 ---
(ii) In a stationary liquid, pressure is same at all
points on a horizontal plane.

(iii) Pressure is same in all directions about a
point in liquid.

(iv) Pressure at same depth is different in different
liquids. It increases with the increase in
density of liquid.

(v) A liquid seeks its own level.

4.5 SOME CONSEQUENCES OF LIQUID
PRESSURE P = hog

(i) In sea water, the pressure at a certain depth
in sea water is more than that at the same depth
in river water : The reason is that the density of
sea water is more than the density of river water.

(ii) The wall of a dam is made thicker at the

bottom : Fig. 4.4 shows the side view of a dam.
The thickness of its wall increases from top towards
the bottom. The reason is that the pressure exerted
by a liquid increases with its depth. Thus as depth
increases, more and more pressure is exerted by
water on the wall of dam. A thicker wall is required
to withstand a greater pressure, therefore, the wall
of the dam is made with thickness increasing
towards the base. In Fig. 4.4, the increasing length
of arrows in water shows the increasing pressure
on the wall of dam towards the bottom.

WATER WALL OF DAM eu

eT as

o 23 Ss

Fig. 4.4 Wall of a dam with its thickness increasing
towards the bottom

(iii) Water supply tank is placed high : To
supply water in a town (or colony), the tank to
store water for supply is made at a sufficient
height. The reason is that as greater is the height
of tank, more will be the pressure of water in the
taps of a house. Thus for a good supply of water,
the height of the supply tank must always be a
few metre higher than the level at which supply of
water is to be made.

(iv) Diver’s suit : The sea divers need special
protective suit to wear because in deep sea, the
total pressure exerted on the diver’s body is
much more than his blood pressure. To withstand

81

it, he needs to wear a special protective suit,
made from glass reinforced plastic or cast
aluminium. The pressure inside the suit is
maintained at one atmosphere.

(v) Size of gas bubble inside the water : It is
noticed that as the gas bubble formed at the bottom
of a lake, rises, it grows in size. The reason is that
when the bubble is at the bottom of lake, total pressure
exerted on it is the sum of the atmospheric pressure
and the pressure due to water column. As the gas
bubble rises, due to decrease in depth, the pressure
due to water column decreases, so the total pressure
exerted on the bubble decreases. According to Boyle’s
law, the volume of bubble increases due to the
decrease in pressure, i.e., the bubble grows in size.
When the bubble reaches the surface of liquid, total
pressure exerted on it becomes just equal to the
atmospheric pressure only which is minimum and so
the size of bubble on surface becomes maximum.
4.6 TRANSMISSION OF PRESSURE IN

LIQUIDS; PASCAL’S LAW

We have read that the pressure due to liquid at a
point in a liquid of density p at a depth h below its
free surface is P = hpg. Obviously, the pressure
difference between any two points x and y in a
stationary liquid will depend only on the difference
in vertical height (Ah) between these points. Now if
by some means, the pressure at one point x is
increased, the pressure at other point y must also
increase by the same amount so that the difference in
pressure between the two points x and y may remain
same. Thus pressure exerted at a point x is equally
transmitted to the point y. This is Pascal’s law. Thus,

Pascal's law states that the pressure exerted
anywhere in a confined liquid is transmitted
equally and undiminished in all directions
throughout the liquid.

This can be demonstrated by the following
experiment.

Experiment : Take a glass flask having narrow tubes
coming out from its sides and bottom. The flask is provided
with an air-tight piston at its mouth as shown in Fig. 4.5. Fill
the flask with water. The water in each tube will be at the
same level. The initial level of water in each tube is shown
by the dotted black line. Now push the piston
down into the flask gently. It is observed that jets of
water rises out from each tube, reaching the same height
which is shown by the upper dotted coloured line. This shows
that the pressure applied to the enclosed liquid is transmitted
equally in all directions every where inside the liquid.

4.7 APPLICATION OF PASCAL’S LAW
Hydraulic machines such as hydraulic press,

hydraulic jack and hydraulic brakes are based on

Pascal’s law of transmission of pressure in liquids.

Principle of a hydraulic machine

The principle of each hydraulic machine is that
a small force applied on a smaller piston is
transmitted to produce a large force on the bigger
piston.

Fig. 4.6 shows two cylindrical vessels P and Q
connected by a horizontal tube R. The vessels
contain a liquid (or water) and they are provided
with water-tight pistons A and B. The vessel P is
of smaller diameter as compared to the vessel Q.
Let area of cross section of the vessel P be A, and
that of the vessel Q be A,. When a weight is placed
on the piston A, it exerts a force F, on the piston A.
Therefore the pressure applied on the piston A is

According to Pascal’s law, the pressure exerted
on piston A is transmitted through the liquid to the
piston B. This exerts an upward pressure P, on the
piston B which is equal to P,. Thus

Since A, > Aj, therefore F, > F,

Thus a small force F, applied on the smaller
piston A can be used to produce a large force F, on
the bigger piston B. This is the principle of a
hydraulic machine which acts as a force multiplier.
4.8 EXAMPLES OF HYDRAULIC MACHINES
(i) Hydraulic press (or Bramah press)

A hydraulic press works on the principle of
Pascal’s law.

Construction : Fig. 4.7 shows a hydraulic
press. It consists of two hollow cylinders P and Q

PIVOT (FULCRUM) LEVER

VALVE V,

WATER
SUPPLY TANK
(RESERVOIR)


--- Page 6 ---
fitted with valves V, and V, respectively, at their”

bottom. The cylinder P has a tank (or reservoir) at
the bottom connected through the valve V,. The
area of cross section of cylinder Q is larger than
that of P. Water-tight pistons A and B are fitted in
these cylinders. Let the area of cross sections of
pistons A and B be A, and A, respectively. The two
cylinders are connected by a pipe R. The piston A
of the smaller cylinder is called the pump plunger
and piston B of the larger cylinder is called the
ram (or press plunger). To press down or raise up
the pump plunger A, a lever arrangement provided
with a handle H is used. The cylinder Q at its
bottom is provided with a release valve which
joins it to the reservoir.

Principle : When a force F, is applied on the
piston A, it exerts a pressure on liquid contained in
the cylinder P. According to Pascal’s law, this
pressure is transmitted through liquid in tube R to
the piston B of the other cylinder Q due to which
the piston B tends to move upwards. Since the area
of cross section of cylinder P is less than that of the
cylinder Q, therefore by applying a small force on
the piston A, we can lift a large weight kept on the
piston B.

When no weight is placed on the piston B,
it rises up against a fixed roof with a force F,
(F, > F,). If a bale of cotton is kept on the press
plunger B, it gets compressed.

Working : When the pump
plunger A is raised by raising the
handle H, the pressure in cylinder
P decreases and the valve V, opens
upwards. As a result, water from
the reservoir tank is pushed up into
the cylinder P by the atmospheric
pressure acting on the free surface
of water in the supply tank. When
pump plunger A is _ pushed
downwards by lowering the handle
H, the valve V, closes due to an increase in
pressure in cylinder P. Now pressure from cylinder
P is transmitted to the connecting pipe R. As the
pressure in pipe R becomes greater than in
cylinder Q, the’ valve V, opens, so water from
cylinder P is forced into the cylinder Q, due to
which the press plunger B is raised against the
fixed roof and the bale of cotton placed on the
press plunger B gets compressed.

When the tunction oF macnine 1s over, the
release valve is opened so that the ram (or press)
plunger B gets lowered and water of the
cylinder Q runs out into the reservoir.

Uses of hydraulic press : A hydraulic press is
used mainly for the following purposes :

1: For pressing cotton bales and goods like quilts,
books, etc.

2. For extracting the juice from sugarcane, sugar
beet, etc.

3. For squeezing oil out of linseed and cotton
seeds.

4. For engraving monograms on goods.

(ii) Hydraulic jack (or Hydraulic lift)

A hydraulic jack is used for lifting heavy
vehicles such as cars, trucks etc., in service stations
for their repairing. It works on the Pascal’s principle
(or the principle of a hydraulic machine).

Construction : A simple form of a hydraulic
jack is shown in Fig. 4.8. It consists of two
cylindrical vessels P and Q connected to each other
by a tube R having a valve V. The piston A in the
narrow cylinder P is attached to a lever and the
piston B of the wider cylinder Q has a platform for
lifting the vehicle. The vessels are filled with a
liquid (say, water).

Working : When handle H of lever is pressed
down by applying an effort, the valve V opens
because of increase in pressure in the cylinder P.
The liquid runs out from the cylinder P to the
cylinder Q. As a result, the piston B rises up and it
raises the car placed on the platform. When the car
reaches the desired height, the handle H of lever is
no longer pressed. The valve V gets closed (since

83


--- Page 7 ---
the pressure on either side of the valve becomes
same) so that the liquid may not run back from the
cylinder Q to the cylinder P.

(iii) Hydraulic brakes

The hydraulic brakes used in cars etc., are also
based on Pascal’s principle.

Construction : Fig. 4.9 shows the hydraulic
brake arrangement of a vehicle. It consists of a pipe
line R containing a liquid (oil), one end of which is
connected to the master cylinder P fitted with a
piston A attached to the foot pedal. The other end of
pipe R is connected to the brake arrangement of
different wheels of the vehicle. Fig. 4.9 shows only
one wheel connected with the pipe line. For each
wheel, there is a wheel cylinder Q having two pistons
B, and B,, attached to the brake shoes. The area of
cross section of the wheel cylinder @Q is greater than
the area of cross section of the master cylinder P.
The brake shoes press against the rim of wheel.

BRAKE SHOE

SPRING
RIM OF WHEEL

Fig. 4.9 Hydraulic brake

Working : To apply brakes, the foot pedal is
pressed due to which pressure is exerted on the liquid
in the master cylinder P, so liquid runs out from the
master cylinder P to the wheel cylinder Q. As a
result, the pressure is transmitted equally and

undiminished through the liquid to the pistons B,
and B, of the wheel cylinder Q. Therefore the pistons
B, and B, get pushed outwards and brake shoes get
pressed against the rim of the wheel due to which
the motion of vehicle retards. Since the area of cross
section of piston A in the master cylinder P is less
than that in the wheel cylinder Q, a small force
applied at the foot pedal produces a large force on
the pistons B, and B, of the wheel cylinder Q. This
is the force responsible for retarding the motion of
the vehicle. It should be noted that due to
transmission of pressure through liquid, equal
pressure is exerted on all wheels of the vehicle
connected to the pipe line R.

On releasing the pressure on the pedal, the liquid
runs back from the wheel cylinder Q to the master
cylinder P and the spring pulls the break shoes to
their original position and forces the pistons B, and
B, to return back into the wheel cylinder Q. Thus
the brakes get released.

Note : In all hydraulic machines, effort is less
than load while the distance moved by effort is
more than the distance moved by load such that
the product of effort and the distance moved by
effort is equal to the product of load and the
distance moved by load (in ideal situation when
there is no energy loss). i.e.,

work done by effort = work done by load.

Thus, mechanical advantage (M.A.)
Load
= Effort 7
and velocity ratio (V.R.)

Hence a hydraulic machine acts like a force
multiplier.

1. A boy weighing 60 kgf is wearing shoes with
heel of area of cross section 20 cm?, while a
girl weighing 45 kef is wearing sandals with heel
of area of cross section 1-5 cm?. Compare the
pressure exerted on ground by their heels when
they stand on the heel of one foot.

Thus the girl’s heel exerts pressure 10 times more
than that of the boy’s heel.

Calculate the pressure due to a water column

At what depth below the surface of water will

water, the total pressure will be equal to twice the
atmospheric pressure.

mercury in the other arm. ie.,

The resultant thrust acting on cube in upward
direction is called upthrust. Obviously this upthrust
depends on the immersed volume (= area of
base x height) of the cube and not on its depth
inside water. Here we can note that if cube is
replaced by a lamina which has negligible thickness
(hk — 0), pressure on the two sides of lamina will
be equal, hence upthrust on it will be zero.

(B) ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND ITS MEASUREMENT

4.9 ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE

The earth is surrounded by air up to a height of
about 300 km from its surface. This envelope of air
around the earth is called atmosphere. The weight
of air column exerts a thrust on the earth surface.
The thrust exerted on unit area of the earth surface
is called the atmospheric pressure. Thus

atmospheric pressive on the ‘serfpGeej eam
Note : The weight of air column over 1 cm?
area on the earth surface is nearly 1 kgf, so the
atmospheric pressure on the earth surface is about
1 kgf per cm? (= 1 kgf/1 cm? = 10 N/10~* m?
= 10° N m”). This implies that a thrust of about
100,000 N acts on every 1 m? of the surface of
objects on the earth. The average surface area of
a human body is about 2 m?, therefore the
atmosphere exerts a total thrust of about 2 x 105 N
on our body. However, we are not aware of this
enormous thrust (or load) on us because the
pressure of our blood (i.e., blood pressure),
balances it. The blood pressure is slightly more
than the atmospheric pressure. However, at high
altitude, the atmospheric pressure becomes less
because the height of air column above that altitude
is less than at the earth surface. As a result, at high
altitudes the blood pressure becomes much more
than the atmospheric pressure and nose bleeding
may occur due to excess blood pressure.
4.10 DEMONSTRATION OF ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE

The existence of atmospheric pressure can be
easily demonstrated in laboratory by the following
simple experiment.
Collapsing tin can experiment

Take a thin tin can fitted with an airtight
stopper. The stopper is removed and a small
quantity of water is boiled in the can. Gradually
the steam occupies the entire space of can
by expelling the air from it [Fig 4.13(a)].
The stopper is then tightly replaced and
simultaneously the flame beneath the can is
removed. Cold water is then poured over the can.
It is observed that the can collapses inwards as

shown in Fig 4.13(b). The reason is that
initially the pressure due to steam inside the
heated can is same as the air pressure outside the
can [Fig. 4.13(a)]. But on pouring cold water
over the can, fitted with a stopper [Fig. 4.13(b)],
the steam inside the can condenses, producing
water and water vapours at a very low pressure.
Now the air pressure outside the can exceeds the
vapour pressure inside the closed can.
Consequently, the excess atmospheric pressure
outside the can causes it to collapse inwards.
This demonstrates that the atmosphere outside
the can exerts a pressure which is the

atmospheric pressure.

4.11 COMMON CONSEQUENCES OF THE
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE

(i) Sucking a drink with a straw : When a drink
is sucked with a straw (Fig 4.14), first the air
in straw goes into our lungs due to which the
air pressure inside the straw decreases. The
atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of
drink being more than the pressure inside the
straw, forces the drink to move up into the
straw which then reaches into our mouth.

(ii) Filling a syringe with a liquid : When

syringe is kept with its opening just inside a
liquid and its plunger is pulled up in the
barrel (Fig. 4.15), the pressure of air inside
the barrel below the plunger becomes much
less than the atmospheric pressure acting on
the liquid. As a result, the atmospheric
pressure forces the liquid to rise up in the
syringe.

In a similar manner, in a water pump,
water is drawn up from a well on pulling the
piston up.

(iii) Filling of ink into a fountain pen : As a

syringe is filled with a liquid due to the
atmospheric pressure, ink also gets filled
into a fountain pen. The pen is kept with its
nib inside ink. When the rubber tube of
fountain pen is pressed, almost all the air of
rubber tube expels out in form of bubbles
through the ink. When the rubber tube is
released, the pressure inside the rubber tube
is much less than the atmospheric pressure
acting on the ink. As a result, the ink rises
into the tube through the capillary below the
nib of the pen.

(iv) Action of rubber suckers : Rubber suckers

are often used as hooks in the kitchen and
bathroom. For this, rubber sucker is pressed
hard against the wall (Fig. 4.16) so that the
air between the sucker and the wall is
forced out, creating a vacuum in between.
The atmospheric pressure acting on it from
outside then holds the sucker alongwith the
hook on it firmly against the wall. For firm
grip, the wall must be smooth.

Action of a siphon system : Water is supplied
from a higher level to a lower level using a
siphon system. Fig. 4.17 shows the siphon
system in which there are two vessels P and
Q. Vessel P is at a higher level than the vessel
Q. Water contained in the vessel P is passed
to the vessel Q by means of a glass (or rubber)
tube AB with one end A kept immersed inside
water in vessel P, while the other end B is kept
open in vessel Q. To transfer water from vessel
P to vessel Q, first air is sucked out from the
tube at the lower end B of it, so that pressure
inside the tube decreases. It becomes less than
the atmospheric pressure acting above the
water surface in vessel P. Due to excess
presure at A, water rises in the tube through
the end A, so as to reach up to the level C.
Then water flows down through the tube from
the higher level C to the lower level B in the
vessel Q due to the difference in pressure of
water at the levels C and B.

PRESSURE

Taking out oil from a sealed oil can : It is
difficult to take out oil from a completely filled
and sealed can by making a single hole in it.
The reason is that there is no air inside a
completely filled and sealed oil can. When the
can is tilted, the pressure due to the column of
oil (inside the can) at the hole is much less than


--- Page 15 ---
the atmospheric pressure outside the can, so the
oil does not flow out of the hole. But if one more
hole is made at the opposite end on the top
cover of the can, air outside the can will enter
in through this hole and will exert atmospheric
pressure on the oil from inside alongwith the
pressure due to oil column.This results in the
increase in pressure on oil, and so it easily flows
out through the hole of the can.

4.12 MEASUREMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE

Atmospheric pressure at a place is measured
by a barometer. Thus

The following three types of barometers are
commonly used :
(i) Simple barometer (ii) Fortin’s barometer
(ii) Aneroid barometer

(i) Simple barometer

In 1643, Torricelli first designed a simple
barometer using mercury as the barometric liquid.

Construction : A
simple barometer has a
hard glass tube of about
1 m length closed at
one end. The tube is
completely filled with ATMOSPHERIC
pure mercury such thatno PRESSURE
air bubble remains inside
the tube. The open end of
tube is closed with thumb troucH
and the tube is then made
upside down several times
so as to force out any air Fig. 4.18 Simple barometer
bubble which might have
entered in it. The completely filled tube with its open
end closed by thumb is then inverted into a trough of
mercury in such a way that the open end of tube is
well immersed in mercury and the tube stands vertical
as shown in Fig. 4.18. Now the thumb is removed.
_ Care is taken that no air enters in the glass tube.

GLASS TUBE
VACUUM

MERCURY

MERCURY

It is seen that the mercury level in tube falls
till its height above the mercury level in the
trough becomes h (= nearly 76 cm) as shown in
Fig. 4.18.

Explanation : In Fig 4.18, the atmospheric
pressure acts at all points (such as C) on the surface
of mercury in the trough. The pressure at point A is
due to the weight (or thrust) of the mercury column
AB above it. When mercury level in the tube
becomes stationary, the pressure inside tube at the
point A which is at the level of the point C, must be
same as that at the point C. Thus the vertical height
of mercury column in it (i.e., AB = h) is called the
barometric height. The space left empty above the
mercury column in the tube is called the torricellian
vacuum. Ideally there should be no air in this space.

Working : If the atmospheric pressure
increases, the pressure at point C increases and
mercury from trough flows into the tube thereby
increasing the vertical height of mercury column
in the tube so as to equalise pressures at the points
A and C. On the other hand, when the atmospheric
pressure decreases, the vertical height of the
column in tube decreases to balance it. Thus, the
vertical height of mercury column from the
mercury surface in trough to the level in tube, is
a measure of the atmospheric pressure.

Barometric height at normal temperature
and pressure : The barometric height at normal
temperature and pressure at sea level is 0-76 m
(or 76 cm or 760 mm) of mercury.

Factors affecting the barometric height :
The barometric height at a place changes only
when the atmospheric pressure at that place
changes.

Note : (1) The barometric height remains
same even when the shape of tube is changed or
the length of tube submerged inside mercury in
the trough is changed or tube is tilted from its
vertical position as shown in Fig 4.19.

space or a drop of water (or liquid) gets into the
tube, it will immediately change into vapour in
the vacuum space and the air (or the vapours of
liquid) will exert pressure on the mercury column
due to which the barometric height will decrease.
Such a barometer is a faulty barometer. The
barometric height of a faulty barometer will be
less than the actual atmospheric pressure.

Advantages of using mercury as a barometric
liquid

A barometre can be made by using any liquid,
but the use of mercury as a barometric liquid is
preferred for the following reasons :

1. The density of mercury (= 13-6 x 103 kg m-*) is
greater than that of any other liquid, so
only 0-76 m height of mercury column is needed
to balance the normal atmospheric pressure. Use
of other liquids require much longer tube.

2. The vapour pressure of mercury is negligible,
so the vapours in the torricellian vacuum does
not affect the barometric height.

3. The mercury neither wets nor sticks to the glass
tube therefore it gives the accurate reading.

4. The surface of mercury is shining and opaque.
Therefore, it is easily seen while taking the
observation.

5. It can easily be obtained in a pure state.

Disadvantages of using water as a barometric
liquid

If water is used in a barometer, it has the
following disadvantges :

1. The density of water is low (= 10° kg m3), so
nearly 10-4 m height of water column is needed
to balance the normal atmospheric pressure.
But it is highly inconvenient to take a tube of
height 10-4 m for a barometer.

2. The vapour pressure of water is high, so its
vapours in the vacuum space will make the
reading inaccurate.

3. Water sticks with the glass tube and wets it, so
the reading becomes inaccurate.

93

4. Water is transparent, so’its surtace is not easily
seen while taking the observation.

Demerits of a simple barometer
(i) There is no protection for the glass tube.

(ii) The surface of mercury in the trough is open
therefore there are chances that the impurities
may fall in and get mixed with the mercury of
the trough.

(iii) It is inconvenient to move the barometer from
one place to another i.e. it is not portable.

(iv) A scale can not be fixed with the tube (or it can
not be marked on the tube) to measure the
atmospheric pressure. The reason is that when
the atmospheric pressure changes, the height
of mercury column in the tube changes. As a
result, the level of free surface of mercury in
the trough changes due to the flow of mercury
in or out of the tube. Therefore, the free surface
of mercury in trough will not remain coinciding
with the zero mark of scale if a scale is fixed
with it to measure the barometric height.

The above demerits have been removed in the
Fortin barometer.

(ii) Fortin barometer

The Fortin barometer is a modified form of a
simple barometer. It is used in laboratory to
measure the atmospheric pressure. It also uses
mercury as the barometric liquid.

Construction : The Fortin barometer shown
in Fig. 4.20 consists of a narrow glass tube of
length about 85 cm to 90 cm. This tube is closed at
one end and has a opening at the other end. It is
completely filled with pure mercury and is kept
inverted in a glass vessel having a leather cup at
the bottom. The cup contains mercury and behaves
like a trough. The open end of tube is dipped into
mercury of the cup. The glass tube is protected by
enclosing it in a brass case. At the bottom of the
brass case, there is a screw S, the end of which
supports the leather cup of the glass vessel. The
leather cup can be raised up or lowered down with
the help of the screw S to adjust the mercury level
in the glass vessel. The mercury level in the glass
vessel is adjusted to coincide with the zero mark
of the main scale graduated in mm attached with
the brass tube. The zero mark of the fixed scale is


--- Page 17 ---
MERCURY

a SCREW S
Fig. 4.20 Fortin barometer

at the tip of an ivory pointer J which is distinctly
visible from outside. The upper part of the brass
tube has a slit in it so as to note the mercury level
in the glass tube. For accurate measurement, a
vernier scale is provided which slides over the
main scale by using the screw R. A thermometer T
is also mounted on the case which records the
room temperature.

Measurement : To measure the atmospheric
pressure, first the level of mercury in the leather
cup is raised up or lowered down with the help
of the screw S so that the mercury level in the
glass vessel just touches the ivory point /. The
position of mercury level in the barometer tube
is noted with the help of the main scale and the
vernier scale. The sum of vernier scale reading
and the main scale reading gives the barometric
height.

(tii) Aneroid barometer

This barometer has no liquid. It is light and
portable and therefore, it can easily be carried from
one place to another. It is calibrated to read directly
the atmospheric pressure. It needs no prior
adjustment like Fortin barometer.

Construction : Fig. 4.21 (a) shows the main
parts of an aneroid barometer. It consists of a
metallic box B which is partially evacuated. The
top D of box is springy and is corrugated in form
of a diaphragm as shown in Fig. 4.21 (b). At the
middle of diaphragm, there is a thin rod L toothed

CIRCULAR SCALE

(b)
Fig. 4.21 Aneroid barometer

at its upper end. The teeth of rod fit well into the
teeth of a wheel S attached with a pointer P which
can slide over a circular scale. The circular scale
is graduated and is initially calibrated with a
standard barometer so as to read the atmospheric
pressure directly in terms of the barometric height.

Working : When atmospheric pressure
increases, it presses the diaphragm D and the rod
L gets depressed. The wheel S rotates clockwise
and pointer P moves to the right on the circular
scale. On the other hand, when atmospheric
pressure decreases, the diaphragm D bulges out due
to which the rod L moves up and the wheel S$ rotates
anti-clockwise. Consequently, the pointer moves
to the left.

Uses of a barometer
A barometer is used for the following three
purposes:

1. To measure the atmospheric pressure at a
place.

2. For weather forecasting.
3. As an altimeter to measure the height.

4.13 VARIATION OF ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE WITH ALTITUDE

‘The atrnospheric pressure decreases with altitude.
‘mainly due to the following two factors:
(i) decrease in height of air column which causes

a linear decrease in the atmospheric-pressure,
Gi) decrease in density: of air which, causes a
' non-linear* decrease in atmospheric pressure.

* The decrease in density of air with altitude is not linear.
It is rapid at low altitude but slow at high altitude.

94


--- Page 18 ---
(i) The atmosphere can be considered to consist
of a number of parallel air layers. Each layer
experiences a pressure on it due to the thrust (or
weight) of the air column above it. Therefore, as
we go up, the height of air column above us
decreases and so thrust exerted by the air column
also decreases, which results in the decrease of
atmospheric pressure with increase in altitude.

(ii) Since the lower air layers get compressed
due to the weight (or thrust) of the upper layers,
therefore, the density of air layers is more near the
earth surface and it decreases as we go higher and
higher. The decrease in density with altitude is not
linear. It is rapid at low altitude (near the sea
level) and is slow at higher altitude. Due to
decrease in density of air with altitude, the
atmospheric pressure also decreases with altitude
in a non-linear way.

Fig. 4.22 shows the variation of atmospheric
pressure with height above the sea level. At Mount
Everest, the atmospheric pressure is only 30% of
the atmospheric pressure at sea level.

Fig. 4.22 Variation in atmospheric pressure
with altitude

Consequences : (1) At high altitudes, since
the atmospheric pressure is less, breathing becomes
difficult and nose bleeding may occur due to excess
of pressure of blood over the atmospheric pressure.
Therefore blood pressure patients are not advised
to go to hill stations or higher altitudes.

(2) At high altitude, a fountain pen leaks. The
reason is that the fountain pen filled with ink
contains some air at a pressure equal to the
atmospheric pressure on the earth surface. When
pen is taken to an altitude, atmospheric pressure at
attitude is low so the excess pressure inside the
rubber tube forces the ink to leak out.

95

4.14 WEATHER FORECAST BY THE USE
OF BAROMETER

The atmospheric pressure at a place is affected
by the change in temperature and the amount of
water vapours present in air at that place. The
reason is that the density of air changes with the
change in temperature and with the change of water
vapours present in it. The density of air decreases
with the increase in temperature and also with the
increase in the amount of moisture present in it
(i.e., the density of moist or humid air is less than
the density of dry air). Consequently, the
atmospheric pressure (or the barometric height)
gradually decreases as the temperature or the
presence of moisture increases. Thus, the change
in the atmospheric pressure helps us to know about
the weather in advance. By seeing the barometric
height, the weather forecast can be made as follows:

(i) If the barometric height at a place suddenly
falls, it means that the pressure at that place
has suddenly decreased which indicates the
coming of a storm or cyclone.

If the barometric height gradually falls, it
indicates that the moisture is increasing i.e.,
there is a possibility of rain.

(ii)

A gradual increase in the barometric height
means that the moisture in air is decreasing.
This indicates the coming of a dry weather.

(iii)

(iv) A sudden rise in the barometric height means
the flow of air from that place to other
surrounding low pressure areas. This indicates
the coming of an extremely dry weather.

(v) If there is no abrupt change in barometric

height, it indicates that the atmospheric
pressure is normal i.e., the weather will
remain unchanged.

4.15 ALTIMETER

An altimeter is an aneroid barometer, but it is
used in aircraft to measure its altitude. Since
atmospheric pressure decreases with the increase
in height above the sea level, therefore a
barometer which measures the atmospheric
pressure, can be used to determine the altitude of
a place above the sea level. Its scale is calibrated
in terms of height of ascent with height increasing
towards left because the atmospheric pressure
decreases with increase of height above the sea
level.

Atmospheric pressure P = hog

‘The atmospheric pressure at a place is 75 cm of
Hg’. What does it mean ? Express it in N m~*.
Use : density of Hg = 13-6 gcm™, g = 9-8 ms~?.
The atmospheric pressure at a place is 75 cm of Hg.
It means that the atmospheric pressure at that place
is equal to the pressure due to mercury column of
height 75 cm.

Given: h=75cm = 0-75 m,g=9-8ms~%,
p = 13-6 g cm? = 13-6 x 10°? kg m ~.

= 0-75 x (13-6 x 10°) x 9-8
= 9-996 x 104 Nm.
The upper blood pressure of a patient is 160 cm
of Hg whereas the normal blood pressure should
be 120 cm of Hg. Calculate the extra pressure
generated by the heart in S.I. unit. Take density
of Hg = 13600 kg m™ and g = 9-8 m s~*.
Given, p = 13600 kg m™, g = 9-8 m s~*
Extra pressure = 160 — 120 = 40 cm = 0-4 m of Hg
From relation P = hp g
Extra pressure P = 0-4 x 13600 x 9-8
= 5-3312 x 104 Pa.

(a) What length of water column is equivalent to
0-76 m of mercury column ? State the
assumption made in your calculation.

(b) Can water be used as barometric liquid ?
Give a reason.

Let h, be the height of water column which will

produce same pressure as height h, (= 0-76 m) of
mercury column.

Then hips = hp.g

— APL
P2

Assumption : The density of mercury is 13-6 times

the density of water i.e., p, = 13-6 p,

(b) Water cannot be used as the barometric liquid
because it will then require the barometer tube
of length more than 10-34 m which will be highly
inconvenient.

A mercury barometer reads 75 cm. Now 3 cm? of

atmospheric air is introduced into the tube. The

mercury falls to a height of 65 cm and the length
of air column above the mercury is found to be

15 cm. Calculate the cross sectional area of the

barometer tube.

Initial volume of air V, = 3 cm? at a pressure

P, = atmospheric pressure = 75 cm of mercury.

hy = 0-76 x 13-6 = 10-34 m.

The level of mercury falls to 65 cm because the air in
the tube exerts pressure on it. Therefore, pressure of
air inside the tube, P, = 75 — 65 = 10 cm of Hg.

Given, length of air column = 15 cm. If A cm7is the
area of cross section of the tube, then volume of the
trapped air V, = 15 x A cm’,

By Boyle’s law, P,V, = P2V,
75 x 3=10x (15 x A)
