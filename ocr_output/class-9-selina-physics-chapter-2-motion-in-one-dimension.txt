(A) SOME TERMS RELATED TO MOTION

2.1 SCALAR AND VECTOR QUANTITIES

The quantities which we can measure are called
the physical quantities. The physical quantities are
classified into the following two broad categories:

(1) Scalar quantities or scalars, and (2) Vector
quantities or vectors.

(1) Scalar quantities or scalars : These are the
physical quantities which are expressed only by their
magnitude. For example, if we say that the mass of a
body is 5-0 kg, it has a complete meaning and we are
completely expressing the mass of the body. Thus, we
need the following two parameters to express a scalar
quantity completely :

(i) Unit in which the quantity is being measured,

and
(ii) The numerical value of the quantity.

Remember that if the scalar is a pure number
(like 1, e?, etc.), it will have no unit.

Examples : Mass, length, time, distance, density,
volume, speed, temperature, potential (gravitational,
magnetic and electric), work, energy, power, pressure,
quantity of heat, specific heat, charge, electric power,
resistance, density, mechanical advantage, frequency,
angle etc.

Scalar quantities can be added, subtracted,
multiplied and divided by the simple arithmetic
methods. Scalar quantity is symbolically written
by its English letter. For example, mass is
represented by the letter m, time by t and speed
by v.

(2) Vector quantities or vectors : These physical
quantities require the magnitude as well as the
direction to express them, then only their meaning is

26

complete. For example, if we say that “displace a
particle from a point by 5 m”, the first question that
will arise, will be “in which direction”? Obviously,
by saying that the displacement is 5 m, its meaning is
incomplete. But if we say that displace the particle
from that point by 5 metre towards east (or in any
other direction), it has a complete meaning. Thus, we
require the following three meters to express a vector
quantity completely :

(i) Unit,

(ii) Numerical value of the quantity and
(iii) Direction.

Examples Displacement, velocity,
acceleration, momentum, force, moment of a force
(or torque), impulse, weight, temperature gradient,
electric field, magnetic field, dipole moment, etc.

The numerical value of a vector quantity
alongwith its unit gives us the magnitude of that
quantity. It is always positive. The negative sign
with a vector quantity implies the reverse (or
opposite) direction. Vector quantities follow
different algebra for their addition, subtraction
and multiplication. A vector quantity is generally
written by its English letter bearing an arrow on
it or by the bold English letter. For example,

velocity is written as ¥ or v, acceleration by g
or a, force by F or F, Obviously the forces F
and — F are in opposite directions.
2.2 REST AND MOTION

Every object in the universe is in motion.

Everyday we see bodies moving around us e.g.
birds flying, cars and buses moving, people


--- Page 2 ---
walking, insects crawimng, animals’ runming' etc. ©
Our earth also moves around the sun so every
thing on it is in a state of motion. The sun and
stars are moving around the centre of their galaxy
and the galaxies too are not at rest.

Although nothing is at rest, but we often say
that a stone lying on the ground is at rest because
the stone does not change its position with respect
to us. Similarly, if we are sitting on a railway
platform and look at a tree nearby, we say that the
tree is at rest because it does not change its
position with respect to us. But when we see a
train leaving the station, we say that the train is
in motion because it is continuously changing its
position with respect to us. Thus,

For a moving body, if the distance travelled in
a certain time interval is much large as compared
to the size of the body, the body can be assumed to
be a point particle. In this chapter, we shall study
the description of motion of a body assuming it to
be a point particle.

One dimensional motion : When a body
moves along a straight line path, its motion is said
to be one dimensional motion. It is also called
motion in a straight line or rectilinear motion. For
example, the motion of a train on a straight track,
a stone falling down vertically, a car moving on a
long and straight road etc., are one dimensional
(or rectilinear) motions. In such a motion,
there is no movement of the body in lateral
direction (i.e., no sideways motion).

If a body moves on a plane along a curved
path, its motion is two dimensional and if it
moves in space, its motion is three dimensional.
In this chapter, we shall consider only the one
dimensional motion.

Representation of one dimensional motion :
The path of one dimensional motion can be
represented by a straight line parallel to the X-axis
if X-axis is taken in the direction of motion. Each
point on the straight line represents the position of
particle at different instants. The position of particle
at any instant f is expressed by specifying the

(at t= 0) (at t=1s) (at t=2:s)

X coorainate at tat instantly AS Me parucie moves,
its x coordinate will change with time t.

Example : The position of a pebble measured
from its starting point, falling freely and
vertically downwards at different instants is given
in the table below :

(in 8)
fete | s | | as | oo

(in m)

The motion of the pebble can be represented
by choosing a proper scale for x on a straight line
along X-axis as shown in Fig. 2.1. Here X-axis
represents the vertically downward direction.

2.3 DISTANCE AND DISPLACEMENT
Consider a body moving

from a point A to a point B
along the path shown in
Fig. 2.2. Then total length of
path from A to B is called
the distance moved by the Fig, 2.2 Motion of a
body, while the length of body from A to B
straight line AB in direction from A to B (shown
by the dotted line in Fig. 2.2) is called the
displacement of the body.
Distance
The total length of path through which a body
moves, is called the distance travelled by it.
The distance travelled by a body depends on
the path followed by the body.

It is a scalar quantity. It is generally
represented by the letter S.

Unit : The S.I. unit of distance is metre (m) and
C.GS. unit is centimetre (cm).

Displacement
The shortest distance from the initial to the
. final position of the body, is the magnitude of
displacement and its direction is from the
initial position to the final position.
It is a vector quantity. It is represented by
—=—_
the symbol S.
Unit : The S.I. unit of displacement is
metre (m) and C.GS. unit is centimetre (cm).

--- Page 3 ---
Representation of displacement : The
displacement being a vector, is represented by a
straight line with an arrow, using a convenient
scale. The tip of arrow on the straight line
represents the direction of displacement, while the
length of the straight line on proper scale represents
its magnitude.

Example: In Fig. 2.3, the vector PO represents
40 m displacement in east direction with scale
1 cm = 10 m (displacement). Here origin P is the
initial position and terminus Q is the final position

Fig. 2.3 Representation of displacement
Distinction between distance and displacement

(1) The magnitude of displacement is either
equal to or less than the distance. If motion is
along a fixed direction, the magnitude of
displacement is equal to that of distance, but if
motion is along a curve or any zig-zag path, the
magnitude of displacement is always less than
that of distance. The magnitude of displacement
can never be greater than the distance travelled
by the body.

Examples: (i) In Fig. 2.2, the body moves
from A to B along a curved path. The distance
travelled by the body is equal to the length of the
curved path AB, but the displacement of the body
is along the straight line AB shown by the dotted
arrow. Obviously the magnitude of displacement is
less than the distance.

(ii) In Fig. 2.4, a boy travels 4 km towards east and
then 3 km towards north. The total distance travelled

by the boy is OA + AB = 4 km + 3 km = 7 km,
but the displacement of the boy is OB = 5 km

in direction OB i.e., 369° due north from east.
NORTH

3km

EAST
4km A

Fig. 2.4 Displacement as a vector

Thus, the magnitude of displacement is the
length of the straight line between the final and
initial positions.

(2) The distance is the length of path travelled
by the body so it is always positive, but
displacement is the shortest length in direction
from initial position to the final position so it can
be positive or negative depending on its direction.

(3) The displacement can be zero even if the
distance is not zero. If a body, after travelling,
comes back to its starting point, the displacement
is zero but the distance travelled is not zero.

Examples: (i) When a body is thrown
vertically upwards from a point A on the ground,
after some time it comes back to the same point A,
then the displacement of the body is zero, but the
distance travelled by the body is not zero (it is 2h
if h is the maximum height attained by the body).

(ii) A body moving in a circular path when
reaches its original position after one round, then
the displacement at the end of one round is zero,
but the distance travelled by it is equal to the
circumference of the circular path (= 2ar if r is
the radius of the circular path).

2.4 SPEED AND VELOCITY

For a moving body, speed is the quantity by
which we know how fast the body is moving, while
velocity is the quantity by which we know the speed
of the body as well as its direction of motion. By
speed we do not know the direction of motion of
the body.

(1) Speed

It is a scalar quantity. It is generally
represented by the letter u or v.

If a body travels a distance S in time ¢, then
its speed v is

Unit of distance

Unit : Unit of speed = Unit of time

Since S.I. unit of distance is metre (m) and
of time is second (s), so the S.I. unit of speed is
metre per second (m s~!) and its C.GS. unit is
centimetre per second (cm s~!).

Uniform speed : A body is said to be moving
with uniform speed if it covers equal distances in
equal intervals of time throughout its motion.

Example : The motion of a ball on a
frictionless plane surface is with uniform speed.

Knowing the uniform speed of a body, we
can calculate the distance moved by the body in
a certain interval of time. If a body moves with
a uniform speed v, the distance travelled by it
in time ¢ is given as :

-(2.2)

Non-uniform or variable speed : A body is
said to be moving with non-uniform (or variable)
speed if it covers unequal distances in equal
intervals of time.

Examples : The motion of a ball on a rough
surface, the motion of a car in a crowded street,
the motion of a vehicle leaving or approaching a
destination etc., are with non-uniform speed.

In case of bodies moving with non-uniform

29

speed, we specify their instantaneous speed and
the average speed.

Instantaneous speed : When the speed of a
body keeps on changing, its speed at any instant
is measured by finding the ratio of the distance
travelled in a very short time interval to the time
interval. This speed is called the instantaneous
speed. Thus,

Instantaneous speed

_ Distance traveliedin a short time interval
Time interval

The speedometer of a vehicle measures the
instantaneous speed.

Average speed : The ratio of the total distance
travelled by the body to the total time of journey is
called its average speed. Thus,

Total distance travelled
Total time taken

In case of a body moving with uniform speed,
the instantaneous speed and the average speed
are equal (same as the uniform speed).

(2) Velocity

The velocity of a body is the distanve travelled
per second by the body in-a specified divection: |

Thus, the rate of change of displacement of
a body with time is called the velocity. It is
numerically equal to the displacement of the
body in | s. ;

It is a vector quantity and is represented by
the symbol # or v. For velocity, both its
magnitude and direction must be spécified. Two
bodies are said to be moving with same velocities
if both of them move with the same speed in the
same direction. On the other hand, if two bodies
move with the same speed but in different
directions or with different speeds in the same
direction, they are said to be moving with different
velocities.

Unit : The unit of velocity is same as the
unit of speed ie. the S.I. unit of velocity is metre
per second (ms~!) and the C.GS. unit is
centimetre per second (cm s!).

Uniform velocity : If a body travels equal
distances in a particular direction, in equal

Average speed = .(2.3)



--- Page 5 ---
intervals of time, the body is said to be moving
with a uniform velocity.

Example : The rain drops reach on earth’s
surface falling with uniform velocity*. A body,
once started on a frictionless surface, moves with
uniform velocity.

If a body moving with a uniform velocity v,
has displacement S$ ina time interval t then by
defirition v= $ /t.

. Displacement

Non-uniform or variable velocity : The
velocity of a body can be variable either due to
change in its magnitude or in its direction or in
both magnitude and direction. If a body moves
unequal distances in a particular direction in equal
intervals of time or it moves equal distances in equal
intervals of time, but its direction of motion does
not remain the same, then the velocity of the body
is said to be variable (or non-uniform).

Examples : The motion of a freely falling
body is with variable velocity because although
the direction of motion of the body does not
change, but the speed continuously increases.
Similarly, the motion of a body in a circular path
even with uniform speed is with variable velocity
because in a circular path, the direction of motion
of the body continuously
changes with time. In fact,
its velocity changes at a
uniform rate. At any instant, © A

tangent to the circular path =v

at that point. Fig. 2.5 shows pip 95 Circular path

different points A, B, C and
D of the circular path.

In case of a body moving with non-uniform
velocity, we specify the instantaneous velocity
and the average velocity.

Instantaneous velocity : For a body moving
with variable velocity, the velocity of the body at
any instant is called its instantaneous velocity. It

but variable velocity

* Initially as the rain drop starts falling, first its velocity
increases due to force of gravity, but very soon, due to viscosity
(or friction) and upthrust of air, the viscous force and upthrust
balances the force of gravity on the rain drop with the result
that the net force on the drop becomes zero. Then the drop
falls down with a uniform velocity called the terminal velocity.

is measured by finding tlhe ratio of the distance
travelled in a sufficiently small time interval, to
the time interval. It is important to have time
interval small enough so that the direction of
motion does not change during this interval.

Average velocity : If the velocity of a body
moving in a particular direction changes with time,
the ratio of displacement to the time taken in entire
journey is called its average velocity. Thus,

Distinction between speed and velocity

(1) The speed is a scalar quantity, while
velocity is a vector quantity. The speed of
a body at a given time tells us how fast the
body is moving at that time. The same
information is also obtained by its velocity,
but the velocity also tells us the direction
in which the body is moving.

For the motion in a straight line, the
magnitude of velocity is its speed. The
speed is always positive, but velocity is
given positive or negative sign depending
upon its direction of motion.

The average velocity of a body can be zero,
even if its average speed is not zero.
Examples : (i) If a body starts its motion
from a point and comes back to the same
point after a certain time, the displacement is
zero, so the average velocity is also zero, but
the total distance travelled is not zero and
therefore, the average speed is not zero.

(2)

(3)

(ii) If a body moves in a circular path and
covers equal distances in equal intervals of
time, the speed is uniform, but due to
continuous change in its direction of motion,
its velocity is variable. The instantaneous
velocity and instantaneous speed are not zero.
The displacement for one round is zero and
therefore, the average velocity is also zero,
but the average speed is 2nr/T if r is the
radius of path and 7 is the time taken in one
round.

2.5 ACCELERATION AND RETARDATION

Generally, bodies do not move with uniform
velocities. The velocity of a body changes
either in magnitude or in direction or both in
magnitude as well as in direction. For example,
the motion of a vehicle in a busy market, or
while leaving or approaching a destination is
with variable velocity. The motion of a planet
or satellite in circular path is also with variable
velocity.

Now we consider the motion only in a straight
line path. Here there is no change in direction of
motion and the change in velocity is only due to
change in speed. In such a case, if the velocity of
body increases with time, the motion is said to
be accelerated, while if the velocity of body
decreases with time, the motion is said to be
decelerated (or retarded). Thus retardation is the
negative acceleration*.

Acceleration

Thus, acceleration i is numerically equal to the
change in velocity in 1 s. ie.,

Unit of velocity

average velocity is zero.

The C.GS. unit of acceleration is cm s~.

Relation for acceleration : Let a body be
moving in a straight line in one direction with an
initial velocity u. Its velocity changes in a short
time interval t and the final velocity becomes v
after time t. Then change in velocity = (v — u)
and time taken = ¢.

(2.7)

If v > u, then a is positive, thus a is the
acceleration. But if v < u, then a is negative, and
a is the retardation.

. vV-u
Acceleration a = wo

or v= utat

Examples: (1) Suppose a car initially at rest, on
starting acquires a velocity 20 ms” in 10 s. The
change in its velocity is 20 ms'-Oms"!
= 20 ms". This change has been brought about in
10 s. Therefore, the acceleration of car is

_ 20ms~'-Oms7! _ 20ms7!

_ 2
10s los 72 ms™.

(2) If a car initially moving with a velocity
25 ms! is brought to rest in 5 s by applying the
brakes, then acceleration of the car is

_ Oms'- 25ms! _ -25ms"!

Ss 5s

or retardation = 5 m s~ (since negative acceleration
is called the retardation).

Acceleration is a vector quantity. It
is represented by the symbol a’. The direction
of acceleration is the direction of change in
velocity. For the motion in a straight line,
the acceleration is in direction of motion of the
body.

=-—5ms?


--- Page 7 ---
It may be mentioned here that the acceleration
of a body does not determine its direction of
motion, while the velocity determines its
direction of motion. The positive or negative sign
of acceleration tells us Whether the velocity i is

positive or « negative sign of vel if ‘tells i its
direction 6f motion. °

The acceleration is

Uniform acceleration :
said to be uniform (or constant) when equal
changes in velocity take place in equal intervals
of time. The motion of a body under gravity (e.g.
free fall of a body) is an example of uniformly
accelerated motion.

Variable acceleration : If change in velocity
is not same in the same intervals of time, the
acceleration is said to be variable. The motion
of a vehicle on a crowded (or hilly) road is with
variable acceleration.

Acceleration due to gravity : When a body
falls freely under gravity, the acceleration
produced in the body due to earth's gravitational
attraction is called the acceleration due to gravity.
It is generally denoted by the letter g. When a
body falls down, its velocity increases with time,
so the acceleration is + g, while if the body moves

vertically upwards, its velocity decreases with time,
so the acceleration is — g (or the retardation is g).

The average value of g is 9-8 m s~ (or nearly
10 m s~). Actually it varies from place to place”.
Thus if a body falls freely under gravity, its
velocity increases at a rate of 9-8 m s~’, ie.,
starting from rest, after 1 s the velocity will be
9-8 m s-!, after 2 s the velocity will be 2 x 9-8
= 19-6 m s"!; after 3 s, the velocity with be
3 x 9-8 = 29-4 m s"! and so on. Similarly, if a
body is projected vertically upwards, its velocity
decreases at a rate of 9-8 m s~, ie., if a body is
projected vertically upwards with an initial
velocity of 49 m s", after 1 s, its velocity will
become 39-2 m sq; after 2 s, its velocity will
become 29-4 m s7!; after 3 s, its velocity will
become 19-6 m s“! and so on.

Note : The value of g does not depend on the
mass of the body. Hence if two bodies of different
masses are simultaneously dropped from a height,
both will reach the ground simultaneously in
vacuum because then there is no effect of friction
and buoyancy due to air.

* On the earth surface, g is maximum at the poles and

mininuon at the equator. The value of g decreases with
altitude and also with depth from the earth’s surface.

(B) GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF LINEAR MOTION

If a body moves in a straight line path, its motion
is in one dimension and is called the linear or
rectilinear motion. A linear motion can be well
studied with the help of the following graphs :

(i) Displacement-time graph,
(ii) Velocity-time graph, and
(iii) Acceleration-time graph.

Note : For motion in one direction in a
straight line since the direction of motion does
not change, so the displacement-time graph and
the distance-time graph are same. Similarly the
velocity-time graph and the speed-time graph
are also same. They differ in two and three
dimensional motions.

2.6 DISPLACEMENT-TIME GRAPH

In the displacement-time graph, the time is
taken on X-axis and the displacement of body is
taken on Y-axis. From this graph, we can
determine the velocity of the body.

Since, velocity is the ratio of displacement
and time, therefore the slope of displacement-
time graph gives the velocity. If the slope is
positive, it implies that the body is moving away
from the starting (or reference) point, but if the
slope is negative, the body is returning towards
the starting (or reference) point.


--- Page 11 ---
Let us consider the following situations:

Case (1) : If the position of a body does not
change with time, the body is said to be stationary
and the displacement as measured from the
origin at all instant is same as that at t = 0, so
the displacement-time graph is a straight line
parallel to the time axis as shown in Fig. 2.7. In
Fig. 2.7, OP is the distance of the body from the
origin O and it remains same at each instant.

Case (2) : If a body is moving with uniform
velocity, its displacement increases by the same
amount in each second and so the displacement-
time graph is a straight line inclined to the time
axis. The velocity of body can be obtained by
finding the slope of the straight line.

Example (1) : A car is moving on a straight
path in a given direction with a uniform speed.
The following table represents its displacement
(i.e., distance from the starting point) at different
instants.

Fig. 2.8 Displacement-time graph with a uniform velocity
The displacement-time graph is a straight line
OP inclined to the time axis (Fig. 2.8). It shows
the linear relationship between the displacement
and time (i.e., the displacement of car is directly
proportional to the time of travel or the car travels

36

equal distance in equal intervals of time in a certain
direction). Thus

For a body moving with uniform velocity,

the displacement is directly proportional to the time
(be, Sx t)

The velocity of car can be obtained by finding
the slope of the straight line OP. For this, take any
two points A and B on the line OP as shown in
Fig. 2.9 and draw perpendiculars AD and BE on
the Y-axis and AF and BG on the X-axis from these

points.

Obviously, larger the slope (_e.. move inctimed

Example (2) : Fig. 2.10 represents the
displacement-time graph of a ball which while
moving on a perfectly smooth floor hits a wall
at t = 6 s and then comes back along the same
line. The displacement (i.e., distance of ball from
the starting point) at different instants of time is
given in the table below.

Thus the slope of the line OA is positive
(= 10 ms~!) which represents the uniform motion
of ball with velocity 10 ms“! towards the wall (i.e.,
away from the starting point), while the slope of the
line AB is negative (=—7-5 m s~') which represents
the uniform motion of ball with velocity 7-5 ms“
towards the starting point after hitting the wall.

Note : The displacement-time graph can
never be a straight line, parallel to the
displacement axis because such a line would
mean that the distance covered by the body in a
certain direction increases without any increase
in time (i.e., the velocity of the body is infinite)
which is impossible.

Case (3) : If a body moves with varying
speed in a fixed direction i.e., with variable
velocity, the displacement-time graph is not a
straight line, but it is a curve. The velocity at
any instant can then be obtained by finding the
slope (or the gradient) of the tangent drawn on
the curve at that instant of time.

Example Fig. 2.11 represents the
displacement-time graph of a body for which

Fig. 2.11 Displacement-time graph witha variable velocity

displacement (i.e., distance from the starting point)
at different instants is given in the table below.

The displacement-time graph i is a curve PQ.

The velocity of body at time tf = 5 s (or when
the displacement S = 30 m) is obtained by
finding the slope of the tangent BD to the curve
drawn at the point A corresponding to t = 5 s or
S = 30 m. Slope of the tangent BD is

BC (50-10)m_ 40m

Slope = Cp =" (7=3)5 = 45.
ie., the velocity of body att=5s or S= 30m
is 10 ms“.

Note that in this case, the slope of the curve
is different at different points, so the velocity is
different at different instants.

Conclusions :

(i)

=10ms'!

(a) If the displacement-time graph of an object,
is a straight line parallel to the time axis, the
object is stationary. (b) If the graph is a straight
line inclined to the time axis, the motion is
with uniform velocity. (c) If the graph is a
curve, the motion is with non-uniform velocity.
(ii) In the displacement-time graph, the slope of
the straight line (or the tangent to the curve
at an instant) gives the velocity of the object
at that instant. (a) If the slope is positive, it
represents the motion away from the origin (or
reference point). (b) If the slope is negative,
it represents the motion towards the origin.
(iii)Knowing the velocity of the object at
different instants from the displacement-time
graph, the velocity-time graph can be drawn.
2.7. VELOCITY-TIME GRAPH

In the velocity-time graph, time is taken on
X-axis and the velocity is taken on Y-axis.

Since velocity is a vector quantity, the positive
velocity means that the body is moving in a certain
direction away from its initial position and the
negative velocity means that the body is moving in
the opposite direction (i.e., towards the initial
position).

From the velocity-time graph, we can
determine (a) the displacement of the body in a
certain time interval and (b) the acceleration of the
body at any instant.

37


--- Page 13 ---
(a) Determination of displacement from
the velocity-time graph : Since, velocity x time
= displacement, the area enclosed between the
velocity-time sketch and X-axis (i.e., the time
axis) gives the displacement of the body.

The area enclosed above the time axis
represents the positive displacement i.e., the
distance travelled away from the starting point,
while the area enclosed below the time axis
represents the negative displacement i.e., the
distance travelled towards the starting point. The
total displacement is obtained by adding them
numerically with proper sign. But the total distance
travelled by the body is their arithmetic sum
(without sign).

Example : Consider the velocity-time graph
of a body in motion as shown in Fig. 2.12.

Then the displacement of the body = area of

fghi = 10 m—- 20 m + 15 m = 5 m, but the total
distance travelled by body = area of A abc + area
of trapezium cdef + area of trapezium fghi = 10 m
+20 m+ 15 m=45 m.

(b) Determination of acceleration from the
velocity-time graph : Since acceleration is equal
to the ratio of change in velocity and time taken,
therefore the slope (or gradient) of the velocity-
time sketch gives the acceleration.

In part bd,

In part de, slope = 0, .. Acceleration = 0
Since the slope is positive in part ab, it is the
accelerated motion; the slope is negative in part
bd, the motion is decelerated or retarded and in
part de the slope is zero, so the motion is with
constant velocity.

Slope = =-5ms*

-2

Now we can consider the following cases :

Case (1) : If a body is in motion with uniform
velocity (i.e., velocity remains constant with time),
the velocity-time graph is a straight line parallel to
the time axis.

VELOCITY (ms7')

TIME (s) ——
Fig. 2.13. Velocity-time graph for uniform velocity

Example : In Fig. 2.13. a straight line AB
represents the velocity-tme graph of a body
moving with a uniform velocity 4 m s“! for 5 s.
The slope of the straight line AB is zero,
therefore. its acceleration is zero.

Displacement in 5 second = area of the
rectangle OABC = OC x OA=5sx4ms!=20 m.

Case (2) : (a) If the body is in motion with
uniform acceleration (i.e., equal changes in velocity
take place in equal intervals of time), the velocity-
time graph is a straight line inclined to the time
axis. The slope of the line gives the acceleration.

Example : The table below represents the
velocity of a body at different instants, starting
from rest.

Obviously, the velocity is increasing by an
equal amount in each second i.e., the body is
moving with uniform acceleration. The velocity-
time graph is a straight line OP inclined to the
time axis as shown in Fig. 2.14.

(b) If the motion is with uniform retardation (i.e.,
its velocity decreases by an equal amount in

a straight line inclined to the time axis with
a negative slope.

Obviously, on velocity-time graph, larger the
slope (i.e., more inclined is the straight line), higher
is the acceleration or retardation.

(c) The velocity-time graph can never be a
straight line parallel to the velocity axis
because such a line would mean that the
velocity increases without any increase in
time (i.e., acceleration is infinite) which is
impossible.

If the body initially is moving with some
velocity and then it accelerates, the velocity-
time sketch for the accelerated motion will
start from the point on the velocity axis
corresponding to the initial velocity of the
body.

and acquiring the velocity 50 m s"!. Then after
hitting the ground, it rises vertically upwards to the
same height with velocity decreasing uniformly. In
this case, the velocity-time graph is shown in
Fig. 2.17 in which part AB shows the downward
journey of body with positive velocity while part CD
shows the upward journey with negative velocity

Conclusions :

(i) (a) For motion with a uniform velocity, the
velocity-time graph is a straight line parallel
to time axis. (b) If the velocity-time graph
is a straight line inclined to the time axis,
the motion is with uniform acceleration.
(c) If the velocity-time graph is a curve, the
motion is with non-uniform acceleration.

The slope of the straight line (or the tangent
to the curve at an instant) gives the
acceleration at that instant. (a) The positive
slope means velocity increasing with time
i.e., accelerated motion. (b) The negative
slope means velocity decreasing with time
i.e., retardated motion and (c) the zero slope
Knowing the acceleration (i.e., slope) at
we can draw the acceleration-time graph.
(iv) The area enclosed between the velocity-time
sketch and the time axis for a certam time
interval gives the displacement in that interval
of time. The area above the time gives
the positive displacement, while the area
below the time axis gives the negative
displacement.

(iii)

Knowing the distance (or displacement) in
different time intervals from the velocity-time
graph, we can draw the distance-time (or
displacement-time) graph.

2.8 ACCELERATION - TIME GRAPH

In the acceleration-time graph, time is taken
on X-axis and acceleration is taken on Y-axis. From
this graph, we can find the change in speed in a
certain interval of time. For linear motion,
acceleration x time = change in speed, therefore
from the area enclosed between the acceleration-
time sketch and the time axis, we get the change in
speed of the body for the given time interval.

(v)

Let us consider the following cases :

Case (1) : If the body is stationary or if it is
moving with a uniform velocity, the acceleration
is zero. The acceleration-time graph in such a

% 40

case is a straight line coinciding with the time
axis (Fig 2.18).

Case (2) : If the velocity of body in motion
increases uniformly with time, the acceleration
is constant (i.e., the motion is uniformly
accelerated). In such a case, the acceleration-time
graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis
on the positive acceleration axis. In Fig. 2.19,
the straight line PQ represents the acceleration-

Case (4) : If the velocity of body changes
in an irregular manner, the acceleration is
variable. The acceleration-time graph will then
be a curve of any shape.

2.9 MOTION UNDER GRAVITY

A body falling freely under gravity moves with
a uniform acceleration of 9-8 m s* (or nearly
10 m s~*). For a body moving vertically upwards,
there is a uniform retardation of 9-8 ms. Thus
motion under gravity is an example of uniformly
accelerated or uniformly retarded motion.

Here we shall consider the motion of a freely
falling body under gravity and we shall use the
acceleration-time graph to obtain the velocity-
time graph and the displacement-time graph. The
acceleration-time graph for such a motion is a
straight line parallel to the time axis.

In Fig. 2.21, straight line AF represents the
acceleration-time graph for a body falling freely
(or moving) with uniform acceleration equal to
10 m s~.

It is evident from the graph that
Initial velocity (att=0) = OA=u
