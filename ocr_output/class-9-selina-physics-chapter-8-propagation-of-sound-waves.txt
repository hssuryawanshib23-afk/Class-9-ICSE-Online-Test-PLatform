(A) PRODUCTION AND PROPAGATION OF SOUND WAVE

8.1 SOUND AND ITS PRODUCTION
FROM VIBRATIONS

Everyday we hear sounds from various
sources. For example, we hear sound of morning
alarm, church bell, school bell, horn of a car (or
bus), barking of dog, music from different
instruments, etc. Although we do not see sound
coming to us, but sound reaches our ears in the
form of waves formed due to the vibrations of
particles of the medium. The waves carry the
mechanical energy of the vibrating particles with
them so as to produce a sensation of hearing in
our ears. Thus

Sound is a form of energy that adh rs js
sensation of hearing in our ears.
Sound is produced by vibrations

Sound is produced when a body vibrates.
Following experiments demonstrate this fact.

Experiment (1) : Stretch a string by holding one end in
mouth between the teeth and the other end in one hand as
shown in Fig. 8.1. Pluck it by the other hand near the middle.

It is noticed that the string starts vibrating
and simultaneously a sound is heard. After some

RUBBER STRING

time when the string stops vibrating, no sound is
heard.

Experiment (2) : Take a thin wire and stretch it between
the two nails about a metre apart. Place a small bit of paper
as rider near the middle of the wire and pluck the wire near
the rider as shown in Fig. 8.2.

It is observed that the rider flies off as the
wire starts vibrating and a sound is heard. After
some time when the wire stops vibrating (i.e.,
when the paper rider placed on the wire, does
not fly off), no sound is heard.

Experiment (3): Take a

rectangular rod of steel (or
aluminium) bent in the U

arm on a rubber pad and
bring it near a table tennis
ball suspended by a thread
as shown in Fig. 8.3.

It is noticed that
as the arm of vibrating

and fro and sound of the vibrating tuning fork is.
heard. When its arms stop vibrating, the ball
becomes stationary and no sound is heard.

Experiment (4) : Take a drum and beat it. The membrane
vibrates which can be felt by touching it and the sound of
drum is heard. As the membrane stops vibrating, no sound
is heard. This shows that the vibrating drum produces
sound.

Experiment (5) : If the string of a sitar (or guitar) is
plucked, the string starts vibrating and its sound is heard.

Similarly on blowing a whistle, the air in whistle starts
vibrating and a sound is heard.

From the above experiments, it is concluded
that sound is produced when a body vibrates. As it
stops vibrating, the sound produced by it ceases.
Thus

A vibrating body is a source of sound.

Sound is a form of energy : Mechanical
energy is required to start vibrations in a body
producing sound. The vibrations of body are
transmitted in medium in form of waves from that
point to the next and so on. These waves on reaching
our ears, produce vibrations in the ear drum which
are perceived as sound by us. Thus, sound is a form
of energy.

8.2. SOUND PROPAGATION REQUIRES A
MATERIAL MEDIUM

Sound produced by a vibrating body travels
from one place to other through the mechanical
vibrations of the medium particles in form of
waves. Thus a material medium is required for
the propagation of sound. This can easily be
demonstrated by the following experiment.

Experiment (Bell jar experiment) : Take an electric bell
and an air tight glass bell jar. The electric bell is
suspended inside the bell jar. The bell jar is connected
to a vacuum pump as shown in Fig. 8.4. As the circuit
of electric bell is completed by pressing the key, the

BATTERY KEY

BELL JAR
ELECTRIC BELL

—* TO VACUUM PUMP
Fig.8.4 Sound requires medium
(bell jar experiment)

hammer of the electric bell is seen to strike the gong
repeatedly and the sound of bell is heard.

Now keeping the key pressed, air is gradually
withdrawn from the jar by starting the vacuum
pump. It is noticed that the loudness of sound goes
on decreasing as the air is taken out from the bell
jar and finally no sound is heard when the entire
air from the jar has been drawn out. The hammer
of electric bell is still seen striking the gong
repeatedly which means that the gong is still
vibrating to produce sound (as hammer strikes the
gong), but it is not heard.

Explanation : When hammer of the bell hits
the gong, sound is produced due to the vibrations
of gong which travels through air to the wall of
jar. This causes the wall of jar to vibrate due to
which the air outside the jar is also set in vibration.
Thus sound is heard by us. But when air has been
removed from the jar, sound produced due to
vibrations of gong could not travel to the wall of
jar, so wall could not vibrate and no sound is
heard. This clearly demonstrates that sound
requires a material medium for its transmission
and it cannot travel through vacuum. Thus,

A material medium is necessary for the
propagation of sound from one place to another.

Requisites of the medium

The medium required for propagation of
sound must possess the following three properties :
(i) The medium must be elastic so that its particles
may come back to their initial positions after
displacement on either side.

(ii) The medium must have inertia so that its
particles may store mechanical energy.

(iii) The medium should be frictionless so that
there is no loss of energy in propagation of
sound through it.

Sound can propagate not only in gases, but
also in solids and liquids. Some materials such as
air, water, iron etc., can easily transmit sound
through them from one place to another. On the
other hand, blanket, thick curtains etc., absorb
most of the sound incident on them and transmit
or reflect only a small fraction of it.

Sound cannot travel in vacuum. On moon,
there is no medium, therefore on moon, one can
not hear the sound produced by the others.

Note : The light does not require any material
medium for its propagation and it can
therefore propagate through vacuum as well.

8.3 PROPAGATION OF SOUND IN A
MEDIUM
When a source of sound vibrates, it creates a
periodic disturbance in the medium near it (.e., the state
of particles of medium changes). The distrubance then
travels in the medium in form of waves. This can
be understood by the following examples.
Example 1 : Take a thin metal strip. Keeping
it vertical, fix its lower end. Push its upper end to
one side and then release it. As it vibrates (i.e. moves
alternately to the right and left) sound is heard.

Fig.8.5 Propagation of disturbance in air

Fig. 8.5(a) shows the undisturbed or normal
position of the metal strip and the air layers on the
right side near the strip in their undisturbed (or
normal) position.

As the strip moves to the right from a to b in
Fig. 8.5(b), it pushes the particles of air in layers
in front of it. So the particles of air in these layer
get closer to each other i.e., air of these layers gets
compressed (or compression is formed at C). The
particles of these layers while moving towards right,
push and compress the layers next to them, which
then compress the next layers and so on. Thus the
disturbance moves forward in form of compression.
The particles of the medium get displaced, but they
do not move along with the compression.

As the metal strip starts returning from b to a
in Fig. 8.5(c) after pushing the particles in front,
the particles of air near the strip starts returning
back to their mean positions due to the elasticity
of the medium.

When the strip moves to the left from a to c
in Fig. 8.5(d), it pushes back the layers of air near
it towards its left and thus produces a space of
very low pressure on its right side. The air layers

on the right side of the strip expand in this region
thus forming the rarefied air layers. This region of
low pressure is called the rarefaction R.

When the strip returns from c to its normal
position a in Fig. 8.5(e), it pushes the rarefaction
R forward and the air layers near the strip again
pass through their mean positions due to the
elasticity of the medium.

In this manner, as strip moves to the
right and left repeatedly, the compression and
rarefaction regions are produced one after the
other which carry the disturbance with it with a
definite speed depending on the nature of the
medium. Gradually due to friction, the strip loses its
energy to the medium and the disturbance dies out.

One complete to and fro motion of the strip
forms one compression and one rarefaction
which together constitute one wave. This wave in
which the particles of medium vibrate about their
mean positions, in the direction of propogation of
sound is called the longitudinal wave. Thus sound
travels in air in form of longitudinal waves.
Actually the longitudinal waves can be produced
in solids, liquids as well as gases. At compressions,
the density and pressure of the medium is
maximum, while at rarefaction the density and
pressure of the medium is minimum.

Example 2 : In the above example,
formation of waves in air could not be seen. The
formation of waves can easily be seen on the
surface of water. If we drop a piece of stone in
the still water of a pond, we hear the sound of
stone striking the water surface. Actually a
disturbance is produced in water at the point
where the stone strikes it. This disturbance
spreads in all directions radially outwards in
form of circular waves (or ripples) on the surface
of water as shown in Fig. 8.6.

PIECE OF STONE

Fig.8.6 Ripples (or waves) formed on the surface of
water on dropping a piece of stone in it

Now if we place a piece of cork on the water
surface at some distance away from the point where
the stone strikes the water, we notice that the cork
does not move ahead, but it moves up and down,
while the wave moves ahead. The reason is that
the particles of water (or medium) start vibrating

169


--- Page 4 ---
up and down at the point where the stone strikes.
These particles then transfer their energy to the
other neighbouring particles and they themselves
come back to their mean positions. This process
continues and thus the disturbance moves ahead
on the water surface in form of waves as shown in
Fig. 8.7. The waves die out as soon as the energy
imparted by stone gets dissipated. However, it is
possible to obtain a continuously travelling wave
if a periodic disturbance is produced at the point
of striking the stone on the water surface.

Fig. 8.7 Propagation of disturbance on the
surface of water.

The wave in which the particles of medium
vibrate about their mean positions, in a direction
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of
the wave, is called the transverse wave. A
transverse wave is composed of crest and trough.
The position of maximum upward displacement
is called crest, while the position of maximum
downward displacement is called trough. The
transverse waves can only be produced in solids
and on the surface of liquids. They can not be
produced inside liquids and in gases.

Characteristics of wave motion : (1) A
wave is produced by the periodic disturbance
at a point in the medium.

(2) Due to propagation of wave in a medium,
the particles of medium vibrate about their mean
positions (without leaving their positions) and
energy is transferred with a constant speed from
one place of medium to the other place.

8.4 SOME TERMS RELATED TO WAVE
MOTION

(i) Amplitude : When a wave passes through
a medium, the maximum displacement of the
particle of medium on either side of its mean
position, is called the amplitude of wave. It is
denoted by the letter a. Its S.I. unit is metre (m).
(ii) Time period : The time taken by a
particle of medium to complete its one vibration
is called the time period of wave. It is denoted
by the letter 7. Its S.I. unit is second (s).

(iii) Frequency : The number of vibrations
made by a particle of medium in one second is
called the frequency of wave. It is same as the
number of waves passing through a point in one

second. It is denoted by the letter f/ n or v (neu).
Its S.J. unit is second-! (symbol s~') or hertz
(symbol Hz).

The frequency f and time period T are
related as

f=

The frequency of a wave is equal to the
frequency of vibration of its source. It is the
characterstic of its source which produces the
disturbance. It does not depend on the amplitude
of vibration or on the nature of medium in which
the wave propagates.

(iv) Wavelength : The distance travelled
by the wave in one time period of vibration of
particle of the medium, is called its wavelength.
It is denoted by the letter A (lambda). Its S.I.
unit is metre (m). It depends on the medium in
which the wave travels.

In a longitudinal wave, the distance
between two consecutive compressions or
between two consecutive rarefactions is equal
to one wavelength, while in a transverse wave,
the distance between two consecutive crests or
between two consecutive troughs is equal to one
wavelength.

(v) Wave velocity : The distance travelled
by a wave in one second is called its wave velocity
or wave speed. It is the speed with which energy
is transferred from one place to the other place
by wave motion. It is not the velocity of an
individual particle vibrating about its mean
position. It is denoted by the letter V. Its S.I. unit
is metre per second (m s~').

It may be noted that the wave velocity is
constant for a given medium. It depends on the
elasticity and the density of the medium. It
changes when the wave passes from one medium
to the other medium.

Displacement-time graph : Fig. 8.8 shows
the variation of displacement with time for a
particle of the medium at a given position, when a
wave propagates through the medium. It is called
displacement-time graph. In Fig. 8.8, the
amplitude is represented by the letter a and time
period is represented by the letter 7. Note that
each particle of the medium goes through such
motion, not simultaneously, but one after another
as the wave moves in the medium.

8.6 SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT
MEDIA

It is our common experience while standing
at some distance from a blacksmith that when a

blacksmith strikes his hammer on an iron piece,
the sound produced on striking the hammer is
heard a short-while after the hammer is seen
striking. Similarly the sound of a cracker is heard
only a little later than it has exploded (i.e., when
flash is seen). This indicates that the sound does
not reach us instantaneously but it travels in a
medium with a finite speed and it takes some time
to reach us from the place where it is produced.
The speed of sound in a medium depends
on the following two factors: _
(i) the elasticity E of the medium, and
(ii) the density p of the medium.
The speed of sound in a medium is given
by the relation

.. (8.4)

where E is the modulus of elasticity (Young's
modulus in case of solids or bulk modulus in case
of fluids*) and p is the density of the medium.

Newton assumed that when sound travels in a gas,
the temperature of gas does not change (i.e., the
propagation of sound is an isothermal change). For
isothermal change, modulus of elasticity is equal to the
pressure ie, E = P. Thus from eqn. (8.4), speed of
sound in a gas is given as

.. (8.5)

For air at normal temperature and pressure (N.T.P.),
P=1-01 x 10° Nm, p= 1-293 kg m™, so Vcomes out to
be 279-5 m s“'. But experimentally the speed of sound in
air is found to be nearly 330 m s™!. Thus speed of sound
calculated by using eqn. (8.5) is found to be lower than the
experimental value.

Later on, the scientist Laplace applied a correction
to the above relation. According to Laplace, when sound
travels in a gas, during the formation of compression and
rarefaction, there is no exchange of heat in the medium
i.e., the propagation of sound is an adiabatic change. For
an adiabatic change, modulus of elasticity E = y P where
Y is the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure to
the specific heat at constant volume (y = C, /C,) and P
is the pressure of the gas.

Hence from eqn. (8.4), the speed of sound in a gas is
given as

...(8.6)

The value of y depends on the nature of the
medium. For air, y is 1-4.

* Fluids include liquids and gases.

171


--- Page 6 ---
This modified formula (eqn. 8.6) gave the correct
value of the speed of sound. At N.T-P. in air, taking
y= 1-4, P= 1-01 x 10° N m? and p = 1-293 kg m°.
V comes out to be nearly 330-7 m s-' which agrees
with the experimental value.

The speed of sound is different in differént media.
The speed of sound is more in solids, less in
liquids and least in gases ( since solids ate niuch

more elastic than the liquids atid’ pases).
The speed of sound is nearly 5100:m:8 ih steel,
1450 m s~ in water and 330 m s in Gir'at °C.
Table below gives the speed of sound in
different media at 0°C.
Speed of sound in some media

Examples showing that the speed of sound in
steel is more than that in air

(1) If sound is produced at one end of a
very long steel bar, two sounds are heard at the
other end. One which reaches first, is propagated
through steel and the other which is heard later,
is through air.

(2) A person living near the railway track
often presses his ear against the steel rail to
guess whether a train is coming or not. The
reason is that the vibrations produced by the
moving wheels of train, travel much faster
through the steel rail than through air. So sound
is heard through track much before it is heard
through air. Thus the person by hearing sound
through the steel rail gets an indication of
coming of train well before its sound is heard..

8.7. FACTORS AFFECTING THE SPEED
OF SOUND IN A GAS

The speed of sound in a gas is affected

by the change in (i) density, (ii) temperature,

(iii) humidity, and (iv) direction of wind.
(i) Effect of density :

P 1
V= he , it is clear that V « \p ie., the
Y p p

speed of sound is inversely proportional to the
square root of density of the gas. The density of
oxygen is 16 times the density of hydrogen,
therefore the speed of sound in hydrogen is four
times the speed of sound in oxygen*.

(ii) Effect of temperature : The speed of
sound in a gas increases with the increase in
temperature of the gas. The reason is that with
the increase in temperature, the density of gas
decreases and consequently the speed of sound
increases. In fact, the speed of sound is directly
proportional to the square root of temperature
of the medium i.e., V < 7 where T is the
temperature of the gas on the Kelvin scale.

The speed of sound in air increases by
about 0-61 ms”! (or 61 cm per second) for each
degree celsius rise in temperature (provided that
the rise in temperature is not very large). i.e.,

V,=Vy +061 t (8.7)

Example : The speed of sound in the dry
still air at O°C is 330 m s“'. At 25°C, the speed
of sound in this air will be
Vos = Vo + 0-61 t= 330 + 0-61 x 25 = 345-25 ms.

(iii) Effect of humidity : The speed of sound
in air increases with the increase in humidity in

From relation

air. The density of water vapour is about th times
the density of dry air at ordinary temperature,
therefore the increase of moisture in air tends to
decrease the density of air. Hence the speed of
sound in the humid air is greater than the speed
of sound in dry air. In other words, the sound
travels faster in humid air than in dry air.

(iv) Effect of direction of wind : The speed
of sound increases or decreases according to the
direction of travel of wind. If wind is blowing
in the direction of propagation of sound, the
speed of sound increases, while if it is blowing

or Vo, = 7 =4

172


--- Page 7 ---
in a direction opposite to that of sound, the speed
of sound decreases.

If V is the speed of sound in still air and W
is the speed of wind, the speed of sound becomes
V + W when wind blows in the direction of travel
of sound and the speed of sound becomes
V — W when wind blows in the direction opposite
to the direction of travel of sound.

Example : The sound of a distant music is
quickly and loudly heard if it is coming with the
wind. On the other hand, it is difficult to hear if
the wind blows in opposite direction.

8.8 FACTORS NOT AFFECTING THE
SPEED OF SOUND IN A GAS

The speed of sound in a gas is not affected
by the change in (i) pressure, (ii) amplitude of
wave, and (iii) wavelength or frequency of wave.

(i) Effect of pressure : The speed of sound in
a gas is independent of pressure. In the formula

YP the ratio —
5° the ratio ©

the change in pressure. When pressure increases,
volume decreases, but mass remains unchanged,
so density increases, such that the ratio P/p remains
constant. For example, if pressure P of a gas is
doubled, volume becomes half, so density p gets
doubled (mass is constant). As a result, the ratio
P/p does not change. Thus, the speed of sound in a
gas is independent of pressure.

(ii) Effect of amplitude of wave : The speed
of sound does not depend on the amplitude of
sound wave.

V= remains unchanged with

(iii) Effect of wavelength (or frequency)
of wave : The speed of sound does not depend
on the wavelength (or frequency) of sound wave.

8.9 COMPARISON OF SPEED OF SOUND
WITH SPEED OF LIGHT

There are the following four points of
distinction between the propagation of sound and
light waves.

(1) The light waves can travel in vacuum, but
the sound waves can not travel in vacuum.

(2) Ths speed of light waves is 3 x 108 ms“!
in air which is about a million times greater than
the speed of sound waves in air (i.e., 330 ms"! at
orc).

(3) The speed of light waves decreases in an

optically denser medium (speed of light in water is
2:25 x 108 ms“, in glass is 2 x 108 ms“), while
the speed of sound waves is more in solids, less in
liquids and still less in gases (speed of sound in steel
is nearly 5100 m s~!, in water is nearly 1450 m s"!
and in air is nearly 330 m s~').

(4) The light waves are transverse
electromagnetic waves while the sound waves in
air are the longitudinal mechanical waves.

Consequences of the large difference in the
speed of sound and that of light

(1) Thunder and lightning : In thunder,
light is seen much earlier than the sound of
thunder is heard, although they are produced
simultaneously. The reason is that light takes
almost negligible time in comparison to sound
in reaching us from the place of thunder because
speed of light is much more (= 3 x 108 m s"!)
than the speed of sound (= 330 m s!).

When the starter in an athletic event fires a
gun, a spectator sitting at a distance hears
the sound of fire a little later while the smoke
iS instantaneously seen. The reason is that
Viight >> Vsound:

The spectators watching the cricket game
hear the sound of stroke a little later than
the batsman is seen actually making it. The
reason is that Vigne >> Vsound-

8.10 EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION
OF SPEED OF SOUND IN AIR

The fact that light travels in air about a
million times faster than sound, can be used to
determine the speed of sound in air.

Experiment : Choose two places A and B at
high altitudes facing each other, at a known
distance d apart (say, about 1 km), in still air. The
distance d is noted. At each place, there is an
observer with a gun and a stop watch. First the
observer at place A fires the gun, while the observer
at place B starts his stop watch immidiately on
seeing the flash of fire at A and stops it when he
hears the sound of fire. The observer at B by his
watch thus finds the time interval t, taken by the
sound to travel from A to B.

Now the observer at place B fires the gun.
The observer at place A starts his stop watch when
he sees the flash of fire at B and stops it when he
hears the sound of fire. Thus the observer A by his

(2)

173


--- Page 8 ---
watch finds the time interval t, taken by sound to
travel from B to A.
The average of the two time intervals is
t +t,
t=

. This is the time taken by sound to

travel the distance d between the places A and
B. The speed of sound is then calculated by using
the formula

Note : In this experiment, we measure the
time interval two times, first for sound to travel
from place A to place B and then from place B
to place A so as to eliminate the error arising
due to flow of wind. However, the speed of
sound so determined is not still very accurate
because of the personal error of the two
observers and the variation in temperature and
humidity of air in between the places A and B.

120 kHz. Determine the minimum wavelength

therefore we can assume that the light takes
negligible time and sound takes 2 s to reach the
observer.

(B) INFRASONIC, SONIC AND ULTRASONIC FREQUENCIES

8.11 INFRASONIC, SONIC

ULTRASONIC FREQUENCES
The human ear is able to hear sound in a
frequency range of about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (or
20 kHz) i.e., the audible range of frequency is
20 Hz to 20 kHz. We can not hear sounds of
frequencies less than 20 Hz or more than 20 kHz.
Actually the audible range of frequency varies from
person to person and it also varies with the age of
the person. The audible range of frequency of a
person decreases as he gets older since his ears lose
the hearing sensitivity to the high frequencies.
Children can hear sounds of some what higher
frequencies say up to 30 kHz, while an old person
can hear sound only up to frequencies 12 kHz.
Hence the audible range of frequency for an average
person is considered to be from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
Even in the audible range, the human ear is not
equally sensitive to all frequencies. The human ear
is most sensitive in the range 2000 Hz to 3000 Hz,
where it can hear even a very feeble sound.

The sound of frequencies in the range 20 Hz to
20 kHz is called the sonic ot audible sound: the
sound of frequency less than 20 Hz is known
as infrasonic sound (or simply infrasonic), while
the sound of frequency greater than 20 kHz is
known as ultrasound (or ultrasonic).
Animals can produce and hear sounds of
frequencies below 20 Hz as well as above 20 kHz.
Different animals have different ranges of audible
frequencies. Elephants and whales can produce
infrasonic sounds of frequencies less than 20 Hz.
Some fishes can hear sounds of frequencies in the
range of 1 Hz to 25 Hz. Some animals can produce
ultrasonic sounds and communicate in them. A dog
can hear sounds of frequencies up to nearly 50 kHz,
a bat up to about 100 kHz, while Dolphins can hear
sounds of even higher frequencies up to 150 kHz.

AND

Frequency ranges for hearing and speaking
by human and animals

10 Hz — 100 kHz
80 Hz — 60 kHz

20 Hz — 50 kHz
200 Hz — 150 kHz
90 Hz — 1-0 kHz
20 Hz - 20 kHz

8.12 ULTRASOUND AND ITS APPLICATIONS

We have read that the sound of frequencies
above 20,000 Hz, is called the ultrasound. Ultrasound
can travel quite freely in solids and liquids, but in gases
its intensity falls. In a medium, it travels with the same
speed with which the audible sound travels. In air, the
speed of ultrasound is 330 m st.

Properties of ultrasound

Ultrasound has all properties similar to that
of ordinary sound, but because of high frequencies,
ultrasound has the following two additional
properties which the audible sound does not possess.

(i) The energy carried by ultrasound is very high.

(ii) The ultrasound can travel along a well defined
straight path. It does not bend appreciably at
the edges of an obstacle because of its small
wavelength (i.e., it has high directivity).

The above two properties of ultrasound makes
it very useful to us for many purposes.

Applications of ultrasound
Few applications of ultrasound are given below.

(1) Bats avoid obstacles in their path by producing
and hearing the ultrasound. They produce
ultrasound which returns after striking an
obstacle in their way. By hearing the reflected

177


--- Page 12 ---
sound, they can judge the direction where the
obstacle is in their way and from the time
interval (when they produce ultrasound and
then receive them back), they can judge the
distance of the obstacle.

(2) Ultrasound is used for drilling holes or making
cuts of desired shape in materials like glass.

(3) For cleaning the minute objects such as the
parts of watches and electronic components,
ultrasound is used. The objects are placed in
a cleaning solution and the ultrasonic waves
are sent into the solution. This causes high
frequency vibrations in the solution and makes
the cleaning easier.

(4) For detection of defects in metals, ultrasound
is used. Ultrasound will pass through the object
if there is no defect (such as crack or cavity),
in the object. But if there is some defect, a
part of ultrasound will get reflected back.

(5) For imaging the human organs, ultrasound is
widely used. Ultrasonography is used to obtain
the images of patient's organs (such as liver,
gall bladder, uterus efc.). It helps to detect
stones, tumors etc. in them. Echo cardiography
is used to obtain the image of the heart.

(6) Ultrasound is used in surgery to remove
cataract and in kidneys to break the small
stones into fine grains.

(7) In SONAR (abbreviated form of sonographic
navigation and ranging) to detect and find the
distance of objects under water, ultrasound is
used.

Difference between ultrasonic and supersonic

The word ultrasonic is used for ultrasound

(i.e., sound of frequency above 20 kHz), while

supersonic is used for object which travels with a

speed greater than the speed of sound in air (ie.,

330 m s“!) e.g. concord jet planes and fighter planes.
