OCR Pipeline – Class 9 ICSE Textbooks
What Problem This Solves

The chapter PDFs are scanned images, not real text.
Normal PDF text extractors fail.

So we built an OCR pipeline to convert:

Scanned textbook PDFs → usable text files


This is a one-time preprocessing step.

What OCR Means (Beginner)

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) =
Reading text from images.

Since scanned PDFs are just images of pages:

PDFs must be converted to images

Images must be cleaned

Text must be recognized from images

Tools Used (Who Does What)
Tool	Role
pdf2image	Converts PDF pages → images
Poppler	System tool that reads PDFs (required on Windows)
OpenCV	Cleans images (better OCR accuracy)
Tesseract OCR	Reads text from images
pytesseract	Python bridge to Tesseract
Python script	Orchestrates everything

Python does not read PDFs or images by itself — it controls other tools.

How the Pipeline Works (From → To)
Scanned PDF
   ↓
PDF → images (pdf2image + Poppler)
   ↓
Image cleaning (OpenCV)
   ↓
OCR (Tesseract via pytesseract)
   ↓
Text saved as .txt files

How to Run

From project root:

python batch_ocr_all_chapters.py

Each PDF → one .txt file (full chapter text).

Why Errors Happened (Normal on Windows)

pdf2image needs Poppler

pytesseract needs Tesseract

Python packages ≠ system binaries

Once Poppler + Tesseract were installed, everything worked.

Important Notes

OCR quality is good for theory text

Equations and symbols may be noisy

Diagrams are not extracted

OCR is done once, not repeatedly

What Comes Next
OCR text
 → clean noise
 → split into concepts
 → generate questions
 → quiz platform


OCR stage is now complete forever.

Status

✅ OCR pipeline working
✅ All 10 chapters processed
🚀 Ready for text cleaning & question generation
